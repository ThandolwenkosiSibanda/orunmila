The effects of WEFS, sucrose, and NaCl concentration on gel formation and stability, gel texture, and gel sensory attributes were evaluated. The results indicated that an increase in WEFS concentration led to increases in the formation rate, stability, and texture of the gel. Addition of a moderate amount of sucrose (2%–3%, w/v) and NaCl (0.4%–0.6%, w/v) improved the stability, gumminess, chewiness, and cohesiveness of the gel. However, the addition of an excessive amount of sucrose (>4%, w/v) and NaCl (>0.8%, w/v) decreased the stability, gel strength, adhesiveness, and springiness of the gel. The sensory attributes of fish scales (FS) gels were mainly affected by WEFS concentration. On the basis of combined textural analysis and sensory evaluation, the FS gels formed with 4% WEFS, 3% sucrose, or 0.4% NaCl was proposed in this study. The gel microstructure and water distribution obviously showed an apparent variation, together with a change in the structure of FS gels. Competing hydrophilic forces and electrostatic interactions varied with sucrose and NaCl concentration, altering the structure and water distribution of FS gels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fish scales gelatin; Gel formation rate; Gel microstructure; Gel stability; Water distribution",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

In this regard, national and local governments are setting goals and actions to tackle this issue. The municipality of Barcelona has set an intervention for the academic year 2020–21: introducing low-carbon meals in public schools. This study assesses the environmental and nutritional benefits of this intervention by applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, with an energy and nutritional functional unit; and combined it with the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus approach, by considering three WEF resources-based impacts (Blue Water Footprint (BWF), Primary Energy Demand (PED) and Land Use (LU)) and the Global Warming Potential (GWP). The transition to a low-carbon meal would reduce between 46 and 60% the environmental impacts. These benefits could even be higher when extra interventions within the school boundaries are applied. More research in behavioural change is needed in order to evaluate both: the acceptance of the new menus by scholars and the adaptation of the school kitchen staff to the new menu. Finally, it is suggested to monitor the environmental and nutritional changes of the introduction of low-carbon meals within the school menus in an integrated way. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Life cycle assessment; Public meals; School canteens; Sustainability; WEF nexus","Behavioral research; Carbon; Global warming; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Life cycle; Nutrition; Behavioural changes; Climate change mitigation; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Local government; Nutritional benefits; Nutritional changes; Primary energy demand; Environmental impact; assessment method; carbon; climate change; environmental conditions; life cycle analysis; local government; nutrition; sustainability; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Varanidae",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Behbahan city in the southwest of Iran has been chosen for the experiment. An extended methodology based on two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods called entropy and linear assignment under intuitionistic fuzzy environment has been chosen to support the synthetic decision to prioritize energy recovery from wastewater treatment technologies. Thirteen criteria including water security principles (Access, Safety, and Affordability), energy security principles (Availability, Accessibility, Affordability, Acceptability, Applicability, and Adaptability) and food security principles (Availability, Access, Utilization, and Stability) have been considered. In terms of the warm and dry weather in Behbahan city, choosing the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) option as the most appropriate option seems rational.

This research develops a stock-flow diagram (SFD) of WEF security in a local context to be used in analysing the impacts of implementing three planned policy interventions in Karawang Regency, Indonesia. STELLA Professional software is employed to build the SFD and conduct simulation of the WEF security nexus, and is based on a previously developed qualitative causal loop model of the same system (the Karawang WEF security (K-WEFS) model). In the quantitative SFD, four scenarios are developed and assessed in this study; (i) population growth changes; (ii) agricultural land conversion rate changes; (iii) changes in the development of artificial ponds and solar energy; and (iv) per-capita resource consumption changes. The results show several interesting findings related to the WEF security nexus, available resources per person (APP) and self-sufficiency levels (SSL) of resources in business as usual conditions and under planned interventions. Potentially unanticipated detrimental indirect impacts of policy interventions are highlighted.

The inevitable interactions between water, energy, and food systems bring about trade-offs but also synergies under different decisions and policies. To gain insights into these issues, we developed a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus model that incorporates both production (supply) and demands sides of WEF systems into a single system-of-systems model using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The model is applied to Saskatchewan, Canada, and so is named WEF-Sask. The model results reveal the various levels of sensitivities of water, energy, and food (and feed) sectors to the socioeconomic and climatic drivers. The analysis of trade-offs and synergies shows that the proposed large irrigation expansion (400%) boosts food production by 1.6% while reducing hydropower production by 2.7% in Saskatchewan. Wind expansion strategy (from 5% to 30% of total capacity) makes synergies that not only contribute to electricity supply but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, industrial water demand, and groundwater use by 2.0, 5.7, and 3.8%, respectively. Biofuel use (blending mandate: 10% ethanol and 5% biodiesel) in transportation cuts GHG emissions by 1.2% but reduces the potential food export (food surplus) by 5.0%. The WEF-Sask model allows for scenario analysis toward integrated resources management, and its generic model structure can be expanded to other regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic impacts; Socioeconomic impacts; Synergies; System dynamics modeling; Trade-offs; Water-energy-food nexus","Biodiesel; Blending; Commerce; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Industrial emissions; System of systems; Water resources; Electricity supply; Expansion strategies; Hydro power production; Industrial water; Integrated resources; Irrigation expansions; Saskatchewan , Canada; Scenario analysis; Economic and social effects; biofuel; ground water; demand analysis; energy resource; food supplementation; irrigation; model test; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; synergism; trade-off; water demand; water planning; water supply; Article; Canada; carbon footprint; energy resource; energy yield; environmental decision making; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; food industry; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); resource management; socioeconomics; water supply; Canada; Saskatchewan",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Recognizing the complex interaction across those highly interconnected resources, the nexus concept evolved to boost efficiencies across all nexus pillars. Several modeling efforts tried to capture the complexity of this problem, but most attempts captured only one or two nexus pillars, remained localized to fixed case-studies or applications, or used simulations to assess pre-defined scenarios rather than solving for optimum solutions under defined objective function and constraints. Here, we present an optimization model for water, energy, and food nexus resource management and allocation at a regional scale. The model was successfully validated using a hypothetical case study to test its efficiency under several resource availability scenarios and different policy targets. The results enhanced the understanding of the interlinkages among the nexus sectors by demonstrating the sensitivity of the WEF nexus to adopted strategies. For example, imposing food variety constraints changed water consumption by an order of magnitude and more than doubled energy requirements. Moreover, adopting renewable energy may cause increased demands for land, but can significantly cut CO2 emissions. The model serves as an effective decision-making tool that enables policy makers to assess multiple WEF sources and recommends the optimum resource allocation under various policy, technology, and resource constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Energy security; Food security; Non-linear optimization model; Planetary boundary; Sustainable resource management; Water security; Water-energy-food nexus","Carbon; Decision making; Resource allocation; Decision making tool; Objective functions; Optimization modeling; Optimum resource allocation; Resource availability; Resource Constraint; Resource management; Sustainable resources; Water resources",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, combining social network analysis (SNA) and discourse analysis (DA).

We look at the economic and environmental dimension expressed throughout a set of specific performance indicators implemented under the Water Energy Food (WEF) nexus framework. Considering that fertilization strategies significatively affect environmental impact as well as economic performance at farm level, we investigated how Precision Agriculture (PA) tools, and particularly VRT, most suitable for increasing efficiency in fertilization distribution, can improve and maximize efficiency of inputs and profitability of individual fields by targeting application where needed and at optimum rates. The study shows how, despite a general reduction of production cost and increase in gross margin, farm sizes and the level of efficiency of the “as usual scenario” influence the economic impact of the VRT. Looking instead at the environmental perspective of the analysis, the results provide evidence of a decrease of nitrogen (N) due to lower amount of fertilizers, as well as a better distribution according to the potential productivity of the field, causing reduced impact of groundwater quality (nitrate loss by leaching). On the other side, some constraints arise from the high cost and the investments needed to adopt VRT at farm level, one of the main challenges to be solved through adequate policy instruments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Fertilization strategies; Precision agriculture (PA) sustainability; Variable Rate Technology (VRT); Water energy food (WEF) nexus; Wheat","fertilizer; agricultural management; Article; Czech Republic; economic aspect; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; fertilization; Greece; hydropower; precision agriculture; priority journal; productivity; rural area; technology; variable rate technology; water quality; wheat",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

To explore this issue, we combine a wide range of primary and secondary environmental, economic, and social data with a triple bottom line / WEF nexus analysis, to demonstrate both the holistic sustainability impacts of desalination for agriculture, and the multi-sectoral policy environment within which desalination is adopted. We apply this approach to 54 privately-owned desalination plants that treat brackish groundwater for agricultural use in the San Quintín Valley of Baja California, Mexico. We find that subsidized energy for local agribusinesses plays an important role in making desalination economically viable in the region. This in turn fuels a large agricultural export industry that represents a significant virtual water transfer to the US market. Rapid population growth in the area driven by agricultural labor needs exacerbates the issues of social equity and sustainability that these subsidies and transfers raise.

To this end, we deploy data collected from various sources, specifically the United Nations (UN), the World Bank (WB), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), World Economic Forum (WEF), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Freedom House (FH), for the years between 2006 and 2018 (13 years). For the analysis of this data, we apply an econometric methodology based on multiple regression models for unbalanced panel data. We may thus report that the higher the perception of quality of public institutions, the greater the level of the variables applied for entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness. We believe our empirical results contain important implications whether for researchers, politicians and decision-makers involved in drafting public policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Competitiveness; Econometric analysis; Entrepreneurship; GEM; Innovation; OECD; Public institutions","competitiveness; decision making; econometrics; entrepreneur; innovation; OECD; panel data; perception; public sector; Varanidae",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

This has prompted the call for a shift from the linear model of tackling the plastic waste issue to that of a Circular Economy model with increasing demand for recycled resin to be incorporated into the plastic production process alongside virgin resin. However, recycled content are often associated with problems like lack of stability between various combinations of virgin/recycle polymers, which may lead to variations in temperature and inconsistency in the ease of flow attributable to the different temperature and pressure regimes under which virgin raw material and recycled feedstock melt and cool. In this paper, our main contribution is a proposed framework for integrating an enhanced AI/DB interface for analysing historical and real time information/data into a joint DSC-TGA system that allows for simultaneous quality control checks and thermal stability tests on different virgin-recycled resin mixing ratios. The database comes equipped with proven estimation methods, testing and statistical analysis results of different resin specimens to serve as a reference point for production engineers in arriving at desired check and test conditions. The information will be particularly useful to plastic product manufacturers when making decisions regarding the right virgin-recycled mix ratio conditions when using different batches of recycled resin or when they switch a supplier. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Enhanced AI/DB interface; Intelligent database; Joint DSC-TGA system; Virgin-recycled polymer mix","Economics; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Quality control; Resins; British broadcasting corporations; Circular economy; Estimation methods; Plastic production; Product manufacturers; Real-time information; Technological innovation; Temperature and pressures; Plastics industry; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; resin; conceptual framework; database; innovation; laboratory method; plastic waste; polymer; recycling; regression analysis; waste management; Article; chemical composition; composting; environmental economics; environmental monitoring; plastic industry; plastic waste; quality control; recycling; temperature sensitivity; thermal analysis; thermostability",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Alternatively, a deterministic WEF estimator is proposed here based on the fast unknown input estimation (FUIE) concept. The WEF is estimated as an unknown input obviating the requirement to represent its dynamics. The proposed observer-based unknown input estimator (OBUIE) inherits the capability of estimating fast-changing signals from the FUIE, which is important when considering irregular wave conditions.

It has been shown that the nonlinear viscous drag force is essential for accurate PAWEC model description, within the energy maximization control role.

The developed WEF-P Tool enabled a trade-off analysis based on integrating supply-chain processes, transportation, and water- energy footprints of the region. Field data from the mining to transportation processes were collected and applied to possible supply-chain scenarios in accordance with the type of product (phosphate rock and slurry). The potential impacts of the scenarios were considered in terms of the water supply in the agricultural areas. The analysis of the positive impacts of dynamic management suggests that seasonal management of phosphate production (less during the irrigated season, more during wetter or rainier seasons) is more effective. Additionally, while the transport of raw phosphate slurry through a pipeline increased the total water required to 34:6-106 m3, which is an increase of 76% over the ""business as usual"" (BAU) scenario, it also resulted in an energy savings of nearly 80% over BAU: slurry transport requires only 40:5-106 L of fossil fuel instead of the 204-106 L required to transport rocks. During the dry or ""water-scarce"" irrigation season (May to July), total groundwater use decreased from 5:8-106 to 5:2-106 m3. Dynamic management of the phosphate industry can also save 143MWh (megawatt-hour) of electricity annually and can bring a reduction of 117 t of CO2 emissions. Making water available at the correct season and location requires analysis of complex scientific, technical, socioeconomic, regulatory, and political issues. The WEF-P Tool can assist by assessing user-created scenarios; thus, it is an effective management-decision aid for ensuring more sustainable use of limited resources and increased reliability of water resources for both agricultural and industrial use.

In the context of global population growth, environmental degradation, and resource shortages, the interrelationship between the water, energy, and food has become increasingly important. In this paper, the city of Ordos in China was selected as a study area. Firstly, this paper sorted out relevant research literature and fully understood the concept of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. Then, an optimization model of WEF system was constructed based on interval number multi-objective programming, which took the comprehensive coordination deviation degree of the WEF system security and carbon dioxide emission minimization as the target. At the same time, the optimization model was constructed with full consideration of constraints such as economic benefit, water resource consumption, energy production, food production and environmental pollution emission. The results showed that the production of coal, thermal power, hydropower, wind power, and food all show an upward trend. Among them, the production of hydropower has the largest change, and the food production has the smallest change. In terms of water resource utilization, food production has the largest allocation of water resources accounting for nearly 80%, followed by coal production, thermal power generation and hydropower generation. The smallest allocation is natural gas. In particular, the allocation of water for coal production and hydroelectric power generation has increased significantly. Finally, the policy recommendations were put forward to promote the sustainable development of WEF system in Ordos.

This study applied an integrated water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analytical model to holistically assess resource availability, distribution, use and management at a local level in Sakhisizwe Local Municipality, South Africa.

This should be undertaken in tandem with selecting an appropriate Wave Energy Converter (WEC), as the characteristics of these devices are critical in capturing the available wave power. Therefore, this paper describes a three-stage systematic approach that was developed and implemented in order to select the most suitable WEC(s) for marine areas identified as optimal for WEFs. As this sector is evolving rapidly, the first stage identified all WECs currently in development and proposed classifying these devices in a practical and meaningful manner. The second stage developed a procedure for identifying generic WEF locations by integrating the multiple dimensions of sustainable development and the technical limitations of the sector, within a geographic information systems framework. Lastly, the third stage incorporates the results from the previous two stages.

At the domestic scale, WEF trade-offs are fairly limited; while all sectors require considerable amounts of energy, the requirements for water and food production are modest compared to other uses. At the international scale, revenues from oil exports in the GCC allow the region to compensate for low food production and scarce water availability. This dependency is dynamic over time, increasing when oil prices are low and food prices are high. We show how reducing domestic trade-offs can lead to higher exposure internationally, with rice imports originating in regions where groundwater is being depleted. However, Saudi Arabia's increased wheat imports, after reversing its food self-sufficiency policy, have had limited effects on groundwater depletion elsewhere. Climate change mitigation links the WEF nexus to the global scale. While there is great uncertainty about future international climate policy, our analysis illustrates how implementation of measures to account for the social costs of carbon would reduce the oil and gas revenues available to import food and desalinate water in the GCC. © 2020 The Author(s).

These complexities proliferate unpredictably therefore investigating and supporting the ability of public agencies to respond effectively is increasingly important. However, understanding how public NRM agencies innovate and restructure to negotiate the range of particular complexities they face is an under researched field. One particular conceptualisation of the social-ecological complexities facing NRM agencies that is of growing influence is the Water–Energy–Food (WEF) nexus. Yet, as a tool to frame and understand those complexities it has limitations. Specifically, it overlooks how NRMs respond institutionally to these social-ecological complexities in the context of economic and organisational challenges—thus creating a gap in the literature. Current debates in public administration can be brought to bear here. Using an organisational cultures approach, this paper reports on a case study with a national NRM agency to investigate how they are attempting to transform institutionally to respond to complexity in challenging times. The research involved 12 elite interviews with senior leaders from Natural Resources Wales, (NRW) and investigated how cultural narratives are being explicitly and implicitly constructed and mobilised to this end. The research identified four distinct and sequential cultural narratives: collaboration, communication, trust, and empowerment where each narrative supported the delivery of different dimensions of NRW’s social-ecological complexity mandate. Counter to the current managerialist approaches in public administration, these results suggest that the empowerment of expert bureaucrats is important in responding effectively to complexity. © 2020, The Author(s).","Culture; Environment; Organisation; Public agency; Social-ecological complexity; Water–Energy–Food nexus","Ecology; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Natural resource management; Natural resource managements (NRM); Organisational; Organisational culture; Public agencies; Public administration; complexity; conceptual framework; economic conditions; natural resource; public administration; resource management; article; case report; clinical article; empowerment; human; hydropower; interview; leadership; narrative; organizational culture; trust; Wales",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Firms that would emerge as leaders are those that reconfigure their production processes through cyber-physical technologies from mass production to customised products and services. For firms to successfully transition they would require, among others, understanding and adoption of new business models, and a workforce skilled in 4IR technologies. Africa has the youngest population with a potential to spur an accelerated economic growth known as a demographic dividend. For Africa, who is viewed as a potential economic powerhouse, the 4IR promises a socio-economic development through better access to technologies and increased productivity. However, the promises of the 4IR for Africa are often told alongside concerns that the 4IR might render the continent's workforce obsolete and reinforce already existing inequalities. The extent to which Africa could benefit from the 4IR would largely be a function of the continent's readiness to put in place policies that equip Africans with the skills needed to play an active role in shaping and benefiting from the 4IR. Yet Africa still lags behind when it comes to transitioning to the 4IR. This research investigated prospects and challenges for Africa in the era of the 4IR.

The Water Energy Food (WEF) nexus is one the avenues for studying the current and future interactions and interdependencies of the WEF sectors under different scenarios and challenges in the effort towards establishing sustainable use of natural resources. Policies around the nexus approach are few or absent at the continental and countrylevels. This paper is a first review on the adoption of the Nexus in two model African countries, Morocco and South Africa. The review compares the water, energy and food sectors and the related national policies, plans and frameworks. The data related to the WEF Nexus revealed key difficulties of availability in both countries. A comparative analysis of the situation in both countries demonstrated differences in policies relating to the WEF Nexus across the sectors: Water, energy, and agriculture.

To address these challenges, the nexus approach provides a framework to identify the interactions of the WEF sectors as an integrated system. However, most nexus studies only qualitatively discuss the interactions between these sectors. This study conducts a systematic analysis of the WEF security nexus in South Asia by using open data sources at the country scale. We analyze interactions between the WEF sectors statistically, defining positive and negative correlations between the WEF security indicators as synergies and trade-offs, respectively. By creating networks of the synergies and trade-offs, we further identify most positively and negatively influencing indicators in the WEF security nexus. We observe a larger share of trade-offs than synergies within the water and energy sectors and a larger share of synergies than trade-offs among the WEF sectors for South Asia. However, these observations vary across the South Asian countries. Our analysis highlights that strategies on promoting sustainable energy and discouraging fossil fuel use could have overall positive effects on the WEF security nexus in the countries.

Yet, in water scarce regions, water-use for irrigation aggravates the competition for the use of water for other purposes, such as energy production, drinking water and sanitation. Solutions for sustainable food production through irrigated agriculture require a systemic approach to assess benefits and trade-offs across sectors. Here, the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus has become an important concept in natural resource management. It has been conceptualized to analyze linkages and trade-offs between the three sectors, across temporal and spatial scales. However, the concept has so far mainly been conceptual, with little empirical evidence or proof of concept in real world cases. The objective of this paper was to take stock of the rapidly advancing literature on the WEF nexus in irrigated agriculture, and to analyze how the concept was actually implemented in research studies, and how the nexus between water, food and energy was actually dealt with. The study period ranges from 2011 to 2019, and includes 194 articles. Results showed that the WEF nexus is indeed very relevant in irrigated agriculture, and the respective literature makes up one third of all WEF nexus papers. Modeling and empirical research have caught up with conceptual synthesis studies during the last four years, thereby indicating that the WEF nexus concept is indeed increasingly operationalized. However, most studies addressed the WEF nexus from a perspective of either socioeconomic, technological or environmental categories, and they place one of the dimensions of water, food or energy into the foreground. To address sustainable development, there is a need to fully integrate across research disciplines and thematic dimensions. Such studies are only starting to emerge. These findings are an important evidence-base for future WEF nexus research on irrigated agriculture, in support of sustainable solutions for water scarce regions, especially in settings undergoing transformations. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy production; Food security; Governance; Soil services; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Transformation; Water resources","agricultural development; drinking water; food production; irrigation system; natural resource; sanitation; sustainability; trade-off; water stress",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Hence, this paper aims to develop a trust-based SNGDM approach with hesitant fuzzy preference relations to the WEF nexus evaluation. In the proposed model, a new fuzzy adjacency matrix and trust score matrix based on expert's self-confidence are defined to imply experts’ trust relationship and trust score, respectively. To improve the reliability of the final decision(s), an iterative algorithm is presented to improve the consistency of experts’ evaluations. Subsequently, the individual evaluation can be aggregated into a group one by using the trust score induced ordered weighted averaging operator while the trust scores of experts are the induced factors. Additionally, an algorithm is utilized to achieve a high level consensus in SNGDM of the WEF nexus evaluation.

These difficulties are related to the lack of local community knowledge of the use and exploitation of water, energy, and food resources; this limited awareness leads to trade-offs, especially in local and marginalized areas. On the basis of data collected from a local community through a survey-based approach, this study examines local community perception of nexus resources and their contribution to livelihoods. The results indicate that community perceptions of nexus resources can be understood through social, natural, economic, human, physical, and environmental livelihood indicators. According to our findings, the perception of nexus resources is based on the benefits of individual resources rather than their interlinkages. This could be the result of community perceptions of a particular nexus resource from three nexus sector, that is, food. Food is the center of nexus resources for the community in the study area. This indicates, that there is a missing link between cross-sectorial resource utilization and management, and full-scale adoption of the WEF nexus to enhance living conditions. Our findings suggest that there is a low understanding of WEF nexus resource use and management, and the livelihood benefit of individual nexus resources is the primary focus in the studied community.

The results show that the situation of water security in Heilongjiang Province is severe. Adoption of the strictest planning pattern will lead to a most significant positive effect among the four development patterns. The consumption of energy under the enhanced development pattern is the most obvious, and the energy security of the whole province could not be guaranteed no matter which development pattern is adopted if the energy consumption is not under control. The food security of Heilongjiang Province is relatively stable and not easily affected by external conditions.

Contributing to this Special Issue on managerialism, we explore GRM as an emerging development paradigm linked tightly to the WEF. Drawing on a historical materialist lens, we examine how the WEF employs GRM to encourage the role of businesses in the sustainable development goals (SDG)s. We focus on SDG 11, safe, inclusive and resilient cities, or what the WEF refers to as well managed cities. We argue that GRM is as a dynamic, uneven and incomplete strategy that serves to consolidate and normalize the role of business as an active development agent, whilst depoliticizing the social and environmental disruptions tied to this arrangement. In pursuing this argument, we historically trace the rise of GRM within the wider backdrop of global political economy of development before exploring the mismanaged urbanization trope employed by the WEF in the global South, and its proposed managerial solutions embodied in GRM. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business-led development; global governance; Global risk management; managerialism; sustainable development goals; urbanization; World Economic Forum",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

We have drawn mappings between the WEF's robustness, resilience and resourcefulness and the structural engineering characteristics of robustness, redundancy and ductility. We use this first to propose a multi-sectoral framework involving the infrastructural, environmental, sociological, economic, and geopolitical sectors, also proposed by the WEF, but divide them into the three hierarchical levels of country, city and building. These three levels, three characteristics and five sectors give rise to a matrix of 45 aspects, with resilience features suggested for some of them. In this way we move towards proposing a multi-sectoral, multi-hierarchical resilience audit for a nation. We then use force-displacement analogies from structural mechanics to quantify resilience through an analogy to energy absorption, depending on the various levels of robustness, redundancy and ductility, thus generating an 8-point scale for a resilience index. The analogy suggests that ductility is the most important characteristic, but that it can be traded-off with redundancy. Redundancy is more important than robustness, but both are much more important for systems that lack ductility compared to those that possess it. © 2020 IEEE.","energy absorption; multi-sectoral; resilience audit; resilience characteristics; structural mechanics analogy","Ductility; Engineering research; Engineering characteristics; Force displacement; Global risks; Hierarchical level; Multi-hierarchical; Resilience index; Structural mechanics; Redundancy","Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa;Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Moratuwa","6th International Multidisciplinary Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference, MERCon 2020","28 July 2020 through 30 July 2020",,162883,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

We employ methods of observation, interviews, focus group discussions and a vision-building workshop to explore the growing vulnerabilities of poor households as they daily navigate deteriorating water quality, rising energy prices and food insecurity. Results indicate that most household-level vulnerabilities relate to energy poverty. Households scale back on water treatment practices such as boiling and the cooking of highly-nutritious yet energy-demanding foods such as beans in efforts to conserve charcoal. Emergent practices of everyday resilience-building include the use of biomass briquettes as an alternative to solid charcoal as well as social networks and capital which allow households to borrow food and energy.

The metrics and characterisations aim to inform decision makers, politicians and the public in general about serious hazards and threats that we face today and, in this way, contribute to more science-informed policies and decisions. How to best identify the highest risks is, however, challenging. Strong criticism has been raised against current approaches, for example the one adopted by WEF.

The results showed that the safety level value of WEF nexus in Xinjiang showed an increasing trend over time from 1997 to 2016. The trend of WEF nexus change in each prefecture presented two stages. Except for Karamay and Urumqi, the safety level values of WEF nexus were on the rise in other prefectures from 1997 to 2009, and the safety level values were significantly different. Half of the prefectures' safety level values showed a downward trend, and the spatial difference of safety level values were decreased from 2010 to 2016. With the change of policy orientation and the continuous improvement of technology, carbon intensity was always an important factor affecting the WEF nexus safety of Xinjiang.

In Taiwan, the food subsystem is water-intensive and energy-intensive, consuming 99% of water and energy resources directly to produce food. The water subsystem directly consumes 87.18% of its energy for water production, but indirectly consumes 12.82% for operations to prepare for water production and supply. However, the energy subsystem indirectly consumes 91% of the energy and 83% of the water from operations to prepare for energy generation. Consequently, direct resource consumption in the food subsystem and indirect operations in the energy subsystem cause more environmental impacts than those caused by others. The results highlight that environmental impacts derive from not only direct resource consumption but also preparation and production for resource generation (indirect consumption). There are approximately 28% of environmental impacts derived from indirect resource consumption in WEF nexus.

Study of the water resources ecological footprint (WEF) has important theoretical and practical significance for the management and optimal allocation of water resources. The current WEF model does not consider the differences between regions because it uses uniform equalization and yield factors. In this study, an improved WEF model is proposed by taking into account the regional characteristics of those two factors and provides results reflecting the consumption and supply of water resources more accurately. Taking Hubei Province, China, as an example, this study calculated the WEF per capita, the water resources ecological carrying capacity (WEC) per capita and the water resources ecological pressure index (WEPI) of each city in 2005, 2010 and 2015, and analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of water utilization. The results from the improved model show that the productive capacity of water resources in Hubei Province is gradually increasing and its pattern changed from a circular pattern with a higher edge and a lower centre to a ladder pattern that is higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest. In addition, the WEF and the WEC per capita show overall upward trends. Due to the differences at different urbanization levels and in the proportions of primary and secondary industries, the water resources pressure is greater in the east Hubei than that in the west. The western canyon region exhibits relatively higher sustainability of the utilization of water resources than the Jianghan Plain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological footprint model; Spatiotemporal pattern; Sustainable utilization; Water resources carrying capacity; Water resources ecological security","water; carrying capacity; ecological footprint; regional security; spatial variation; sustainability; temporal variation; urbanization; water demand; water footprint; water management; water use efficiency; Article; China; city; ecological footprint model; ecological phenomena and functions; environmental management; pressure; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urbanization; water supply; ecology; ecosystem; environmental protection; China; Hubei; Jianghan Plain; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Water Resources",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

What should be the primary objective, reducing or eliminating surplus food production, requires great change within social, cultural and economic structures. The secondary approach of redistributing surplus food to areas of deficit (in terms of socio-economic groups and/or geographic regions) involves a significant logistical burden, and suffers the same issues as with the elimination of waste. The least desirable, but perhaps most practicable approach, is the use of food waste as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion (AD). The strategic adoption of AD can therefore be seen as an important step towards mitigating food waste, but the implementation of efficient AD systems on a large (county/region) scale involves significant complexity. The optimal number, size and location of AD plants, and whether they are centralised versus decentralised, may be determined by considering factors such as supply and proximity to feedstock, transport links, emission hazards and social impact. Reaching balanced and objective decisions when faced with such disparate criteria is inevitably very difficult. To address this problem we prototype and evaluate a decision support tool for county-scale AD planning. Our approach is a hybridised Agent Based Model (ABM) with a Multi Objective Optimisation. We capture the spatio-temporal dependencies that exist in the water, energy and food systems associated with energy derived from food waste using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The use of Interactive Multi Criteria Analysis as visual analytics offers a means to communicate the co-benefits and trade-offs that may emerge, as well as prioritise the AD strategies, based on the prioritization of criteria. Specifically, the method supports exploration of the social, environmental and economic impact of different AD strategies and decisions, linked to current issues, namely AD scale and adoption. The results highlight a trade-off between transport costs and social acceptability for the AD centralised versus decentralised strategies. When low carbon options are weighted higher then slow, steady and aggressive decentralised strategies are the best strategic adoption of AD. Conversely, when Energy production is considered a priority, then aggressive scaling up in a centralised approach is best with slow and steady approaches being further from the ideal. The framework has demonstrated that it permits a space for dialogue and transparent prioritization of AD strategies based on WEF nexus impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Complex systems; Decision support tool; Energy; Food; Hybrid approaches; Nexus; Uncertainty; Water","Anaerobic digestion; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Feedstocks; Food products; Large scale systems; Multiobjective optimization; Simulation platform; Visualization; Water; Water conservation; Agent-based model; Decision support tools; Energy; Hybrid approach; Nexus; Uncertainty; Economic and social effects",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Accordingly, it is necessary to adopt comprehensive measures to reach sustainable development goals. This objective can be achieved by the application of interdisciplinary and professional approaches through establishing dynamic and optimal balance in supply and demand resources. However, such important optimization approaches have been rarely practiced at the watershed scale. The present study has been therefore formulated to apply a linear water-energy-food nexus optimization for the Shazand watershed, Markazi Province, Iran. This approach was applied for planning 14 crops planted in orchard, irrigated farms, and rain-fed farms, between 2006 and 2014, and targeting water-energy-food nexus index (WEFNI) maximization. The connections among the water, energy, and food were then evaluated through determining the amount of consumption, mass productivity, and economic productivity of water and energy. The results of WEFNIs revealed that almond has the highest WEFNI with values of 0.92, 0.76, 0.76, 0.83, 0.86, 0.86, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.88.

Contemporary tight carbon reduction targets urge the need to deploy renewable energy technologies however due to interdependencies across the WEF nexus, various technologies are beneficial for some but not all sectors. This paper quantifies the impacts of future possible AD technology diffusion choices on the environment, society and economy. This can aid decision makers to identify the potential consequences of various AD alternatives within the next three decades. The study considers an integrated WEF nexus approach and accounts for the interdependencies within the nexus. This was done by developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) and simulating the relations between the main players within the nexus, thus examining the upscaling of AD diffusion and its consequences for water consumption, energy production, transportation, landfill use, food waste processing and digestate generation. Three future WEF nexus scenarios, that reflect potential alternatives of society and technology in Great Britain up to 2050, were utilised by the ABM implementation to test the sensitivity of AD diffusion choices. These scenarios describe possible changes to lifestyle, governance, technologies, climate, and social structures. Accounting for the uncertainty associated with such future simulations, the Monte Carlo method was employed to estimate the potential variations in scenario outputs. Results suggest that decentralisation results in the largest carbon reduction, but can incur more costs. Centralisation consumes 35% more water but produces 37% more energy (biogas). The paper has visualised the scenario outputs graphically to highlight the consequences of neglecting the inter-relationships between environmental, social and economic aspects of AD. © 2019","Agent-based model; Anaerobic digestion; Future scenarios; Uncertainty; Water-energy-food nexus","Autonomous agents; Carbon; Computational methods; Decision making; Diffusion; Economics; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Simulation platform; Uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Future scenarios; Potential variations; Renewable energy technologies; Society and technologies; Uncertainty; Various technologies; Water energy; Anaerobic digestion",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment methods were adopted covering the options from ""cradle to grave"". The fertilisation with human urine included the collection, storage, transportation, application and field emissions, while the fertilisation with mineral fertilisers included primary production of fertilisers, transportation, application and field emissions. The reference flows were based on the fertilisation of 1 ha of maize with 225 kg of nitrogen, 29 kg of phosphorus and 48 kg of potassium oxide. We analysed the environmental aspects such as nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, energy demand and water depletion, as well as environmental impacts such as global warming, human toxicity, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, water scarcity and resource depletion. The agricultural fertilisation with full volume of human urine closer to the source presented smaller energy demand and environmental impact indicator values when compared to solid mineral fertiliser, despite the uncertainties. The fertilisation with human urine was more advantageous with transportation distances up to 134 km (energy demand) and 84 km (environmental categories) by truck compared to 1841 km of mineral fertiliser. Ammonia volatilisation control was key to reduce acidification and eutrophication indicator values. When considering additional gains such as the reduction of water demand and wastewater generation from a waterless collection of human urine, the indicator values of environmental aspects and impacts of fertilisation with human urine were smaller than those with mineral fertiliser and reached a break-even point of 193 km (energy demand) and 185 km (environmental categories).

The average WEF can be used to calculate the upper bound on the average block error rate (BLER) of a code selected at random from the ensemble of i-polar codes. Also, we propose a concatenated coding scheme that employs P high rate codes as the outer code and Q i-polar codes as the inner code with an interleaver in between.

This has led to an increase in production of biodiesel which is produced from palm oil. However, as palm oil is also used for food, it is important to take this into consideration as well. Also, oil palm cultivation is rather water-intensive. Hence, it is necessary to analyze the interlinkage between water, food, and energy to have a holistic understanding and prevent trade-offs when addressing one issue in isolation. The water-energy-food nexus for oil palm cultivation in Thailand has been conducted following two widely used methods, the Water-Food-Energy Nexus (WFEN) and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus assessment method. The results are demonstrated as a single score, which is easier for suggesting a suitable area for oil palm plantation. The assessment indicates the southern region of Thailand is the most suitable for oil palm plantation. The recommendation is consistent with the suggestion of the government, based on land and climate suitability. However, this study considers more comprehensive aspects including various other environmental aspects. Oil palm cultivation mainly relates to the amount of freshwater consumption, leading to the increment of fuel consumption for pumping water. On the other hand, the effectiveness of fresh fruit bunch yield (for food and energy production) should be developed in the future. Besides, the results recommend the central region for the expansion of oil palm cultivation in the future because of the availability of a good irrigation infrastructure. © 2020","Oil palm plantation; Quantitative nexus results; Water-Food-Energy nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The proposed theoretical model is grounded in marketing literature, extends the theory of planned behavior, and empirically tested in the Indian market. A survey with questionnaire was administered to gather data from 510 respondents from the state capital of the country. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses; the results confirm adequate support for the theory of planned behavior and proposed theoretical model. In addition, ECCB found to be significantly influenced by the consumers' environmental knowledge, and perceived environmental consequences, and environmental concern was significantly related to WEF. The study implies that green marketers should direct their marketing efforts towards integrating these four pro-environmental behavior determinants in order to facilitate the ECCB and WEF for green products. For promoting the ECCB, green marketers should strengthen environmental knowledge and perceived environmental consequences to target consumers, and for augmenting the WEF, they should improve the environment concern among consumers. This study contributes to the mainstream literature by ascertaining the distinctive impact of the four noteworthy determinants of pro-environmental behavior on ECCB and WEF in emerging markets. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","environmental behavior; green consumers; green marketing; India; pro-environmental; willingness",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

However, accurate prediction of heat transfer coefficients remains an elusive task because of the complex fluid and thermal behavior in these two-phase systems. In this study, a machine learning based approach for predictingheat transfer for saturated flow boiling in mini/micro channels is proposed. A consolidated database of 16953 data points for flow boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-channels is amassed from 50 sources that includes 16 working fluids, reduced pressures of 0.0046 – 0.77, hydraulic diameters of 0.15mm – 6.5mm, mass velocities of 19 &lt; G &lt; 1608kg/m2s, liquid-only Reynolds numbers of 27 – 55270 and flow qualities of 0 – 1. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed based on the universal consolidated database that was split into training data and test data, and used to predict the saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficients. An optimization is conducted and ANN model architecture is selected which consists of dimensionless input parameters: Bd, Bo, Co, Frg, Frgo, Frf, Frfo, Prg, Prf, Reg, Rego, Ref, Refo, Sug, Suf, Weg, Wego, Wef, and Wefo, and hidden layers (75,70,60,50,30,20,10) that predicts the test data with an MAE of 14.3%. The ANN model is superior to universal correlations for saturated flow boiling heat transfer at predicting the test data, even predicting individual databases with high accuracy. The robustness of the ANN model was tested by excluding databases from the training datasets altogether and utilized to predict these excluded databases. The ANN model did extremely well when a working fluid data was included in the training dataset, and poorly when a working fluid data was excluded from training dataset. The use of a universal ANN model utilizing a consolidated database can become an extremely useful tool when it comes to predicting heat transfer coefficients for saturated flow boiling in mini/micro channels. © 2019","ANN; Flow boiling; Heat transfer; Saturated; Universal data","Database systems; Fluids; Forecasting; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Reynolds number; Artificial neural network modeling; Artificial neural network models; Flow boiling; Flow boiling heat transfer; Saturated; Saturated flow boiling heat transfer; Thermal management systems; Universal data; Data communication systems",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Existed WEF nexus research is mainly confined to qualitative analyses, and it needs constant improvement and increases quantitative analyses. In China, water security is the most prominent problem in the WEF-nexus, which is manifested in the competitive relationship between food and energy production for water. Therefore, the matter of alleviating water resources stress has become a difficult and hot issue. After improving the existed water footprint accounting method for food and energy production, this study calculated the food water footprints (blue water footprint and green water footprint) in the 31 provinces of mainland China in 2015, as well as the blue water footprints of major energy systems (coal, oil, natural gas and thermal power generation). This study proposed water resources pressure index (IWS), water resources pressure contribution rate of food and energy (WCR), water consumption rate of food and energy (n) and competition composite index (CCI) of WEF, which were used to evaluate the consumption of water resources in food and energy production in different regions, and assess the intensity of competition for water resources in food and energy production. The results showed that the national food water footprint in 2015 was 690.8 Gm³, and the blue food water footprint was 287.8 Gm³. The main water-consuming blue energy water footprint was 18.5 Gm³, and coal production accounted for 9.9% and thermal power generation accounted for 87.6%. According to the competition indicators, the competition relationship among the administrative regions of the 31 provinces in mainland China was obtained. For example, 5 provinces had serious competition and 19 provinces had weak competition. The water consumption of the energy industry continues to grow rapidly by economic development.

However, current research mainly focuses on mapping causal loops and the hierarchy structure; equations in interaction exploration have been largely ignored. Using the panel data of China's 30 provinces from 2005 to 2016, this paper adopts a simultaneous equations model (SEM) to evaluate intensities between related factors in the local WEF-Nexus. We define a local WEF-Nexus as containing core, peripheral and interactive sub-nexuses, and decouple the core sub-nexus from the supply, consumption and waste disposal processes. Results show that effective irrigated area, secondary industry rate and crop sown area are key positive influencing factors in the WEF subsystem, with positive impact coefficients of 1.0426, 0.6986 and 1.149, respectively. Food production (-0.303) and chemical fertilizer used per sown area unit (-0.3129) are key negative factors in the WEF subsystem. Additionally, urban green land (0.4436) and total population (0.5815) exert specific influences on the water and energy subsystems, with a 1% increase in urban green land resulting in a 0.4436% increase in water consumption. The system boundary, two positive feedback loops and seven nexus points are identified, with total groundwater pumping being the only nexus point exerting an holistic impact across the WEF equations.

This paper focuses on the San Antonio Region of Texas: a resource hotspot characterized by rapid urbanization, increased energy production in the Eagle Ford Shale Play, and growing agricultural activity. The paper reports on a survey sent to 370 researchers and regional stakeholders from governmental, non-governmental/non-profit, and business organizations in the Region's water, energy, or food sectors. The study goals were to 1) evaluate levels of convergence in perspectives regarding the water, energy, and food challenges in the Region; 2) quantify existing levels of communication of both researchers and regional stakeholders with identified WEF organizations in the region; and 3)identify barriers to and opportunities for improving communication between the WEF organizations and the researchers involved. The authors found aspects of convergence between surveyed regional stakeholders and researchers. Aspects of convergence exist between both groups regarding the potential of different Texas Development Water Board strategies to address future water challenges. Modest levels of communication were reported between surveyed researchers and regional stakeholders with other identified WEF organizations.

Sustainable agriculture goal is to establish innovative and new farm tools and service capacities that help the intensive farm sector to optimize input management (energy, nutrients and water) and productivity. The main objective of this paper was to investigate, in a durum wheat production system in central Italy under Mediterranean conditions, the following aspects: (i) environmental sustainability of fertilization treatments through the energy inputs/outputs analysis and reduction of Nitrate (N-NO3) in water cycle; (ii) agricultural system agronomic and economic performance and (iii) to identify regulatory and economic instruments actually in place to promote sustainable fertilization. To describe and address the sustainability assessment of durum wheat production system we adopt the “Water Energy Food nexus” (WEF) as conceptual framework. The findings of this research showed that there is a great difference between the marketable yields obtained with mineral fertilization strategies and those by organic fertilizer, while considering the environmental sustainability, our results provide evidences of the significance of the reduction of energy use and the high value of renewable energies and the decreasing of non-renewable one. At the same time the reduced impact of groundwater quality due to the organic fertilizer seems to be an interesting result to be analyzed in the long-term perspective.

The main argument to uphold here is that smartness approach has been traditionally more focused on smart urban planning and smart specialization. Design/methodology/approach: An evaluation by index, correlation and significance analysis is used to present original empirical evidence from six CEE countries. Findings: Smartness approach integration into economic development justifies the identification of SED determinants: basics (welfare, digitality, environmental, social responsibility) and enhancers (learning, networking, agility, innovations and knowledge-driven). The interaction between SED and countries’ competitiveness in CEE countries might be described by two approaches, namely, focus-based (several most important basics and enhancers) and balance-based (equal importance of basics and enhancers). Research limitations/implications: The limitations relate to the particular sample of CEE countries and gathering opportunities of statistical data. Practical implications: The combination of SED-Index sub-indices and WEF GCI might aid a more accurate ex ante measurement. Despite common global challenges, each country should choose its own combinations for smartness determinants to achieve long-term competitiveness. Social implications: The findings are important for fostering smartness approach in economic development for long-term competitiveness. Originality/value: This paper contributes to economic development literature by discovering basics and enhancers for SED. By linking well-known term of competitiveness and economic development with a concept of smartness, the new approaches, namely, focus-based and balance-based, to policy making in CEE countries emerged. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CEE countries; Competitiveness; Smart economic development; Smartness",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

We analyse a territory in the Northeast portion of the São Paulo State, where it is located the Sepé Tiaraju agrarian reform settlement in interface with two municipalities. We suggest that agrarian reform areas can activate a progressive and concrete environmental change at the local level where food is the key element to redefining the area’s nexus.

Here we evaluate the sustainability trends of an important regional WEF nexus using Jiangsu Province, China, as a case study. Using statistical data from 2000 to 2016, we propose a step-by-step methodological approach to evaluate sustainability and carry out empirical research to examine it. The methodology constructs a composite index, combining single WEF sector indicators and WEF linkage indicators that reflect the characteristics of the nexus. This enables exploration of differences in assessment results based on the concept of strong and weak sustainability. Such differences are obvious in the evaluation results based on sustainability surplus compensation (SSC) and sine sustainability surplus compensation (SSSC) methods. The analysis confirms that Jiangsu Province is following a path of unsustainable development of the WEF nexus. This is mainly due to substandard indicators of the water and energy systems, some of which are declining.

Managing, conserving and maximizing the potential of each component is a major global concern considering the many challenges to be faced in the 21st century. The aim of this study was to identify, in the literature, recommendations for public policy, research and development, and practices for the WEF Nexus, aimed at promoting sustainable development considering stochastic and risk elements. In this regard, this paper presents a literature review of the contribution scientific studies have made toward better understanding the importance of the WEF Nexus in the context of sustainable development. Research indicates that the WEF Nexus cannot be discussed as independent sectors, highlighting the need for integrated policies and inter-sectoral and international cooperation to promote sustainable development. Therefore, the effective management of the WEF Nexus requires science-based data using risk and stochastic elements to assist policy and decision-making. Thus, in a situation of rapid global changes, decision-making processes for this Nexus must be assisted by multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral approaches, aimed at avoiding the unintended effects of a single sector approach (e.g., energy policies stimulating hydroelectricity production need to consider factors affecting conservation and food production). With regard to the effects of climate change on the WEF Nexus, risk and stochastic elements must be considered when developing a science-based model for the sustainable management of WEF resources. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Global risk; Stochastic elements; Sustainable development; Water–energy–food nexus","Climate change; Climate models; Environmental protection; International cooperation; Planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Decision making process; Effective management; Global risks; Literature reviews; Research and development; Scientific studies; Stochastic elements; Sustainable management; Decision making",,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus

However, the direct and indirect effects of these facilities on the mortality, occurrence and behaviour of rare and threatened species are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review to examine the potential impacts of WEF on grouse species. We studied whether grouse (1) collide with wind turbines, (2) show behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine developments, and (3) if there are documented effects of WEF on their population sizes or dynamics. Our review is based on 35 sources, including peer-reviewed articles as well as grey literature. Effects of wind turbine facilities on grouse have been studied for eight species. Five grouse species have been found to collide with wind turbines, in particular with the towers. Fifteen studies reported behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine facilities in grouse (seven species), including spatial avoidance, displacement of lekking or nesting sites, or the time invested in breeding vs. non-breeding behaviour. Grouse were affected at up to distances of 500 m by WEF infrastructure, with indications of effects also at bigger distances. In six cases, a local reduction in grouse abundance was reported in areas with wind turbines, which possibly affected population size. Due to the differences in study duration and design, we cannot provide general conclusions on the effects of WEF on grouse populations. We advise applying the precautionary principle by keeping grouse habitats free of wind energy developments, in particular where populations are small or locally threatened. Future studies should preferably apply a long-term before-after-control-impact design for multiple areas to allow for more general conclusions to be drawn on the effects of WEF on rare and threatened wildlife species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.","Before-after-control-impact design; Collision; Displacement; Habitat suitability; Tetraoninae; Wind turbine","anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; collision; design; displacement; gamebird; literature review; population size; wind power; wind turbine; Tetraonidae",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus

In the focus of this research is the superstructural position of the World Economic Forum (WEF) as an ideational fulcrum for the transnational capitalist class (TCC) for hegemonic project consensus building. Using economic documents from the WEF's proposed Gross Domestic Product replacement composite index, I conduct rhetorical analysis and ideological criticism asking two questions: Does the WEF rhetorically constitute a policy group for the Globalist Bloc? If so, what are the hegemonic ideologies promulgated by such a body. As materializes rhetorically, the documents simultaneously exhibit that the WEF is a space for consensus building and project planning amongst the TCC. What is revealed by the text is that the TCC (immanent to the WEF) is self-conscious and is monitoring global civil society's frustrations, responding to these frustrations in a rather sophisticated manner, and implementing its own desired agenda through the governments of the world via surface level hegemonic actions elucidated in the discourse.

This paper researches that wind energy is utilized to directly drive the axial fan with the vertical wind turbine, to realize the underground ventilation. This integrated equipment is called wind energy fan (WEF). In this way, the energy loss, which is caused by the repeated energy conversion due to the wind energy generation and the motor-driven fan, will be greatly decreased. According to the rational design and calculation of model schemes, the experiment platform is established to analyze the performance of lift and resistance wind energy fan. Meanwhile, the experiment tests the rotating speed of WEF and the air volume of experiment duct under transmission ratios of 1:1, 1:5.17 and 1:10. The experiment results show that the efficiency of lift WEF is higher than that of resistance WEF. The transmission ratio has a big influence on the air volume of wind energy fan, and the certain transmission ratio should be selected to improve ventilation efficiency. The investigation shows this scheme is an effective wind energy technology to realize the active utilization of wind energy in underground engineering ventilation. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Speed increaser; Wind energy fan; Wind turbine","Air conditioning; Energy conversion; Energy dissipation; Transmissions; Ventilation; Wind turbines; Experiment platforms; Integrated equipment; Transmission ratios; Underground engineering; Underground ventilation; Ventilation efficiency; Wind energy generation; Wind energy technology; Wind power",,"11th International Symposium on Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, ISHVAC 2019","12 July 2019 through 15 July 2019",,238519,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

We summarise the diversity of birds killed by turbine collisions at 20 wind energy facilities (WEFs) across southwest South Africa. Monitoring from 2014 to 2018 recovered 848 bird carcasses across all WEFs, at a crude rate of 1.0 ± 0.6 birds turbine−1 y−1 at 16 WEFs with at least 12 months of postconstruction monitoring. However, mortality estimates adjusted for detection and scavenger bias were appreciably higher: 4.6 ± 2.9 birds turbine−1 y−1 or 2.0 ± 1.3 birds MW−1 y−1 (n = 14 WEFs with site-specific bias correction factors), which is slightly lower than mean rates reported in the northern hemisphere, but still well within range. A striking result was the high diversity of birds killed: 130 species from 46 families, totalling 30% of bird species recorded at and around WEFs, including some species not recorded by specialist surveys at WEF sites (e.g. flufftails Sarothruridae). Species accumulation models suggest that 184 (±22) species will be killed at these facilities, some 42% of species found in the vicinity of WEFs. This is despite the smaller number of migrants in the study region, compared with the north temperate zone. Diurnal raptors were killed most often (36% of carcasses, 23 species) followed by passerines (30%, 49 species), waterbirds (11%, 24 species), swifts (9%, six species), large terrestrial birds (5%, 10 species), pigeons (4%, six species) and other near passerines (1%, seven species). Species of conservation concern killed include endangered Cape Vultures Gyps coprotheres and Black Harriers Circus maurus, both of which are endemic to southern Africa. Every effort must be made to site wind energy facilities away from important areas for birds, particularly raptors. © 2020, © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","bird diversity; bird fatality rates; bird turbine collisions; postconstruction monitoring; wind energy",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

In recent times, these WEFs have been threatened by over-exploitation, land-use changes, and biodiversity loss. This study aims to investigate the diversity of WEFs and their contribution to household income for communities living around the National Park. Methods: The study was conducted in three sub-districts adjacent to Gunung Leuser National Park. The plant materials were randomly collected from three sub-districts, while local knowledge was gathered through a structured survey and in-depth interviews. The informant sample comprised 450 people, 150 from each of the three sub-districts. Results: A total of 54 wild edible fruit plants belonging to 41 genera and 27 families were recorded in the study area. Thirty-nine (72.22 %) species were found growing in forests, 12 (22.22 %) species in farmland, and 3 (5.56%) species occur in the bush. Several species have economic value including Baccaurea macrophylla (Müll.Arg.)

These fruits formed a source of household income and were harvested by approximately 82% of respondents. The sale of WEFs contributed approximately 34.31% of the total annual household income. These findings confirm the assumption that WEFs are important for the generation of household income. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of WEFs to local communities in Aceh Tamiang, Indonesia, particularly rural communities living near Gunung Palung National Park. WEFs play an important role in rural livelihoods by ensuring food, medicine, and sustained income.

Most attention has been directed at identifying potential synergies and trade-offs among sectors that could be addressed with improved technologies and management. The governance of the WEF nexus more broadly has received comparatively little attention, and the importance of scale in space and time has been largely ignored. Inspired by scholarship on multi-level governance in individual sectors, this paper identifies four scale-related governance challenges in the WEF nexus, namely: (1) scalar fit, which arises when planning and operating procedures work at different levels along the scales of space and time in different sectors; (2) scalar strategies, wherever the levels at which actors have influence and in which action takes place are contested and negotiated; (3) institutional interplay, where rules and norms in different sectors influence each other at different levels; (4) scalar uncertainty, arising out of the complexity of multi-level and multi-scale interactions. The relevance of these four challenges is illustrated with case studies from developed and developing countries. These examples show the importance of considering multiple levels and scales when assessing the likely effectiveness of WEF nexus governance mechanisms or proposals. The cases underline the need to pay close attention to issues of power, contestation, and negotiation, in addition to the analysis of institutional design. Thus, this paper recommends that nexus governance efforts and proposals be scrutinized for scale assumptions. The four identified challenges offer a suitable starting point for diagnosis. © 2020, The Author(s).","Multi-level governance; Scalar governance challenges; Water–energy–food nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

Participating in this effort are Chevron, Eni, Shell, and the Colorado School of Mines (Mines). This paper assesses the effectiveness of project components, such as industry guest lectures, summer internships, and program improvement and provides lessons learned for human resources development initiatives. This paper utilizes the qualitative research method in which data are collected through focus group interviews. Key participants of the study include students enrolled in the WEF program and faculty members. Moreover, the interviewing process involves students that are not part of the WEF program as a control group to measure progress made with additional benefits. The article explains major challenges of talent development in higher education institutions. It has been determined that the local specifics, especially students' socio-economic and educational background, play an important role on future academic success. For example, students encountered difficulties with understanding course materials and industry guest lectures, which is attributed to English language barriers. Yet, select students have had strong success in the upper-intermediate and above levels. Students' internships revealed that summer experience has greatly strengthened their practical knowledge and skills, opened eyes to industry settings, and more importantly, influenced better planning of career paths. Students reported internships not only provided an industry outlook but also perspectives of continuing graduate studies. It is noted that workforce development requires sufficient faculty development in a case of scarce human resources. The competent and adequate faculty, especially in petroleum engineering (PE), is a prominent problem in most developing oil and gas countries. This issue was articulated among stakeholders, and the project results demonstrate the successful case of company support to raise professional competencies of SU faculty. This paper covers the human capital development challenges within the WEF project framework, and based on scientific evidence, further elucidates the project-specific tools to propagate similar initiatives around the world. Kazakhstan's experience, as a former Soviet Union state, brings useful suggestions to transform higher education talent development to match the industry-wide standards.

These are applied to determine the influence of each of the 12 indicators for the labor market that are presented as part of The World Economic Forum's (WEF’s) ”The Global Competitiveness Report 2019” on The United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Index. The research objects are countries from each of the four categories of nations, as distinguished by UNDP, in the Human Development Index. By unifying the 2019 data from UNDP and WEF, a data set is formed. Findings: It is substantiated that in modern economic practice, it is impossible to achieve the “ideal” conditions necessary for applying existing methodological approaches to the social management of human capital, which reduces how effectively current approaches function. Foundation on the existing methods leads to uncertainty as to management of human capital, which is social by 95.14% in 2019. Though the achieved value of the social management of human capital is close to being optimal, it is still not enough to achieve a high level of human development, which was 0.685 on average for the global economy in 2019 and is likely to increase by 31.43% until 2025, for acknowledging the social market status of the modern economy. Originality/value: It is proven that there is a need for a new, mixed, methodological approach to the social management of human capital, which would optimally combine the best practices of both state and corporate management. The principles for the practical implementation of such an approach are offered, and proposals are developed to substantiate the contribution of this approach to the achievement of the global goals of sustainable development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Basic principles; Corporate social responsibility; Methodological approaches; Regulation of the labor market; Social management of human capital; Social market economy; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus

This paper endeavours to advance the institutional theory by proposing a conceptual model that encompasses institutional factors that have received minimal attention from researchers. The proposed model is developed based on the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2015, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), and includes seven factors, namely: economical dimension, legal dimension, ethical dimension, technological dimension, educational dimension, infrastructure development, and financial market development. The study suggests seven propositions linking the institutional factors with entrepreneurship intention. This is an exploratory investigation and no quantitative analysis has been conducted. Future research could adopt or adapt the current study’s conceptual framework and empirically test it. Furthermore, empirical studies could be applied in different contexts and accommodate different institutional conditions.

However, there are discrepancies in employability skills vision between higher education students’ perspectives and those of employers. This study aims to recognize higher education students’ perspectives about employability skills and to compare them with the labour market employability skills as requested by employers. A questionnaire was designed to test graduate students’ perspectives on employability using the WEF 2020 employability skills. The results show that students are not fully aware of the fourth industrial revolution employability skills, thus, there is a gap between future labour market demand and students’ perspectives about future employability skills.

Identification, development and implementation of resource recovery solutions in an industrial setting is a challenge that requires careful assessment of environmental impacts, technology readiness level (TRL), economics as well as other implementation aspects. This manuscript will first introduce these multi-disciplinary concepts followed by four case studies that are each at a different level of technological maturity and have a unique economic value proposition. The technologies demonstrated in these case studies directly convert either food waste, waste energy or wastewater into valuable raw materials. Using the case study experience as a basis, a roadmap to commercialisation is discussed where the focus is on understanding industrial needs, the role of industrial symbiosis and the current challenges that must be overcome.

Paradoxically, policy’s and politicians’ great trust in the basic forces of the business world is accompanied with a disinterest in how they are captured in analytical approaches. The purpose of this paper is to discuss what consequences different approaches to interaction present for policy attempts to use business forces to achieve change. Design/methodology/approach: The discussion of theoretical approaches available for policy aiming to use the basic forces of business exchange for efficiency, innovation and industrial/societal renewal in specific directions is designed as follows: The authors identify two main choices of dimensions in the conceptualisation of business exchange, based on the acknowledgement of thin or thick interactions. The authors discuss how these are related to how interaction patterns appear in empirical studies of exchange. Based on the identification of conceptualisations and empirical findings, the authors discuss the ability for the public sphere to use the basic characteristics of business exchange to cope with societal challenges. Findings: Research experiences on thick interaction and its consequences, that businesses and their input and output are interdependent, systemic and promote certain development paths, are largely ignored in approaches used in policy circles. Instead, policy advisors’ and policy commissioners’ understanding of business interaction patterns is coloured by mainstream economies assumption of thin interaction. The content and function of the market as depicted in this tradition are within EU, the basic foundation for legal regulations and limitations of businesses interaction patterns. Simply put, actors as well as the activities and resources that they are related to are approached as independent. Research limitations/implications: This paper is focussed on the conceptual underpinnings of contemporary policy advices and commissions. This paper does not investigate deviations from these advices and commission made by policy practitioners on a local level Practical implications: The message given by theoretical approaches recognising thick interaction is that the thicker it is, the more intervening, broader and more differentiated the policy tools and measures have to be. But that also puts high demands on policy actors on all levels to have both general and specific knowledge about thick interaction patterns. However, given the big challenges the society is facing, increased speed of change and, above all, increased influence over the direction of change are needed. Social implications: WEF recognises the systemic features of the contemporary challenges to society with climate change in the foreground, and it stresses the need for finding new ways for public bodies and private businesses to cooperate to solve this. This implies the need to consider what theoretical approaches that should guide policy advice and measures. Hence, there is a need for the use of more sophisticated analytical approaches to the collective level, instead of those relying on that the interaction pattern of the business world is thin, straightforward and easy manageable. Originality/value: This paper takes a novel approach to policy advice and policy commissions through focussing on what kind of theoretical concepts and approaches that actually are available for policy advisors and policy commissioners interested in using the basic forces of business exchange to increase efficiency and innovation in the public setting in general and furthermore to solve specific problems and to create new, specific development paths. Hence, both approaches adopted and neglected by policy are considered. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Market thinking; Networks; Policy; Systemic thinking",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus

Methods: The School Children’s Mental Health in Europe (SCMHE) survey collected data on primary school children living in six European countries, using self-reports (SR) from children (Dominic Interactive), as well as combination of parent- and teacherreports (P/T C) (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) to assess internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. The World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) Global Gender Gap report’s Gender Gap Index (GGI) was used to categorize countries with high and low gender gap. Results: Boys had greater odds of externalizing problems (OR = 2.6 P/T C, 1.95 SR), and lower odds of internalizing problems (OR = 0.85 P/T C, 0.63 SR). The gender gap’s association with mental health problems was different depending on the informant used to identify these problems. A small gap was a risk factor based on reports from adults for externalizing (OR = 1.53) and internalizing problems (OR = 1.42) while it was a protective factor for SR internalizing problems (OR = 0.72). For these problems the gender gap impacted boys and girls differently: a small gender gap was protective for boys but not for girls, including when controlling for key confounding variables. Conclusions: The differential impact of country-level gender gap observed between self-reported and parent- or teacher-reported mental health is complex but nevertheless present trough mechanisms that are worthwhile to study in depth, with a special attention to the informants and the type of problems examined. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Children; Externalized disorders; Gender; Gender gap; Internalized disorders; Mental health",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus

The authors used logical conclusions, the selection of necessary information, and systems analysis when considering the business environment and state regulation measures in the countries of the region. It is noted that the banking sector of Kazakhstan is the most integrated one into the global financial system. Uncertainty in the development of banks in Kyrgyzstan, the isolation of the banking sector in Turkmenistan, and the dependence of credit institutions in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan on administrative intervention are presented. The rates of competitiveness of the financial markets of Central Asian countries are very low - even Kazakhstan, with a fairly developed market of securities, is in 114th place among the 144 countries of the world. Legislation regulating the operation of the stock markets of the Central Asian countries has not yet been formed, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan do not meet international standards, and Tajikistan and Turkmenistan do not officially have stock exchanges. The example of Kazakhstan shows that the capitalization of the stock market is growing, and the stock market ecosystem has been built. The placement of shares of national companies on the London Stock Exchange allowed for the increase of capital, but small trading volumes, an insufficient number of financial instruments, and a limited number of investors hinder the development of the domestic stock market.

Mc7fer/a/sar?d/Wef/70ds:Ti-Zr and Ti standard-diameter implants (4.1 mm) and Ti-Zr narrow-diameter implants (3.3 mm) in cylindrical (parallel) macrodesign were simulated in the mandibular and maxillary first premolar area. Forces of 100 N were applied to the crowns in a vertical and oblique (45-degree angle to the long axis) direction. The von Mises stresses and fatigue strength values of the implants and principal stresses in the bone structures were evaluated. Results: In vertical and oblique force application, stress data in cortical and trabecular bone structures were found to be higher in 3.3-mm Ti-Zr narrow-diameter implant models than 4.1-mm Ti-Zr and Ti standard-diameter implant models. Also, the von Mises stress data of the 3.3-mm Ti-Zr narrow-diameter implants were higher than the 4.1-mm Ti-Zr andTi standard-diameter implants. The shortest cycle of fatigue failure and estimated duration of clinical success (years) results were found in the mandibular 3.3-mm Ti-Zr implant model under oblique force, and these results remained below the identified 30-year critical threshold. Conclusion: Considering all implant models, Ti-Zr narrow-diameter implants exhibited higher stress values than Ti-Zr and Ti standard-diameter implants. In the premolar region, care should be taken biomechanically when using Ti-Zr narrow-diameter implants as an alternative to standard-diameter implants.

This study aimed to determine whether a smartphone application (app) reduced the unmet needs among people newly diagnosed with cancer. Methods: A single blind, multisite randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of an app-based, 4-month intervention. Newly diagnosed cancer patients were approached at three health service treatment clinics. Results: Eighty-two people were randomized (intervention; n = 43 and control; n = 39), average age was 59.5 years (SD: 12.9); 71% female; 67% married or in a de facto relationship. At baseline, there were no differences in participants’ characteristics between the groups. No significant effects, in reducing unmet needs, were demonstrated at the end of intervention (4-month) or 12-month follow-up. Overall, 94% used the app in weeks 1-4, which decreased to 41% in weeks 13-16. Mean app use time per participant: Cancer Information, 6.9 (SD: 18.9) minutes; Appointment Schedule, 5.1 (SD: 9.6) minutes; Cancer Services 1.5 minutes (SD: 6.8); Hospital Navigation, 1.4 (SD: 2.8) minutes. Conclusions: Despite consumer involvement in the design of this smartphone technology, the app did not reduce unmet needs. This may have been due to the study being underpowered.

This research provide the national policy incumbents and the counties with a basis for the formulation of developmental policies streamlined toward a uniform regional development as well as to increase the productivity and competitiveness of certain area Analyzed in the paper is the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), which evaluates the Croatian economy and devises a report on the competitiveness of global economy. Also analyzed in the paper is the Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) in a triennium (2007, 2010, and 2013) for the territory of eastern Slavonia, populated by 797,891 inhabitants, i.e., by 18.9% of the entire Republic of Croatia’s population. We applied a comparative analysis of eastern Slavonia and of the Republic of Croatia pursuant to the statistical and perceptional indicators. The secondary data sources (for comparative analyses) were used, significant on national an EU level. Research was conducted using the methodology of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and of the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), wherewith a consistency concerning the competitiveness measurements on a national level is obtained. With regard to the previous regional competitiveness researches (Regional Competitiveness Index 2007, Regional Competitiveness Index 2010), the alterations in the competitiveness profile of certain counties are observable in 2013, but the least competitive counties have remained to be so, while the most competitive ones have retained the previous status. Most of the indicators used, like the gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and unemployment, manifest the results of a developmental behavior, not the factors on which a developmental capacity depends. According to the GCI, the Republic of Croatia has stagnated the last 10 years. Therefore, the Regional Competitiveness Index, in view of methodology and focus, contributes to the enrichment and systematization of informational basis concerning the factors on which competitiveness, and thereby also a developmental performance on a county level, i.e., on a subnational level, depend. © 2020, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

Local stakeholder engagement through a group model building (GMB) approach was applied in Karawang Regency, Indonesia, to develop the model with the goals of improving problem understanding, raising consensus among participants, and building acceptance and commitment regarding the subsequent development of a quantitative nexus model. After recognizing the issues regarding water, energy and food sectors in the study area and eliciting opinions about nexus interactions, the next stage was to build a conceptual framework to describe the nexus system and to develop an integrated causal loop diagram (CLD) that describes critical system (inter-)linkages. The developed Karawang WEF security (K-WEFS) model is composed of six sub-models with water, energy and food sectors as endogenous factors. In addition, population, economic and ecosystem services were considered as exogenous drivers of the system. It is expected that all the major internal and external factors and drivers are covered, including possible feedback mechanisms, and key variables will be analysed further in the system. The future achievement of WEF security targets can be based on robust evaluation and planning processes underpinned by thorough understanding of whole system dynamics and the impacts of changes in the linked sectors, even in a qualitative way. In this way, a first step towards breaking silo thinking in regional planning may be attained. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Causal loop diagram; Group model building; Nexus modelling; Water-energy-food (WEF) security","Ecosystems; Food supply; Regional planning; Causal loop diagrams; Conceptual frameworks; Feedback mechanisms; Group model building; Internal and external factors; Problem understanding; Stakeholder engagement; Water energy; Model buildings",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Stressors such as climate change and population growth have highlighted the fragility of our WEF systems, necessitating integrated solutions across multiple scales. While a number of frameworks and analytical tools have been developed since 2011, a comprehensive WEF nexus tool remains elusive, hindered in part by our limited data and understanding of the interdependencies and connections across the WEF systems. To achieve this, the community of academics, practitioners and policy-makers invested in WEF nexus research are addressing several critical areas that currently remain as barriers. First, the plurality of scales (e.g., spatial, temporal, institutional, jurisdictional) necessitates a more comprehensive effort to assess interdependencies between water, energy and food, from household to institutional and national levels. Second, and closely related to scale, a lack of available data often hinders our ability to quantify physical stocks and flows of resources. Overcoming these barriers necessitates engaging multiple stakeholders, and using experiences and local insights to better understand nexus dynamics in particular locations or scenarios, and we exemplify this with the inclusion of a UK-based case study on exploring the nexus in a particular geographical area. We elucidate many challenges that have arisen across nexus research, including the impact of multiple scales in operation, and concomitantly, what impact these scales have on data accessibility. We assess some of the critical frameworks and tools that are applied by nexus researchers and articulate some of the steps required to develop from nexus thinking to an operationalisable concept, with a consistent focus on scale and data availability.

We introduce the “Nexus at Home” as a starting point for exploring the dynamics of WEF resource use and household sustainability. Drawing on two research projects we focus specifically on domestic kitchens as a site where practices of cooking, eating, cleaning and disposing of waste come together. While these practices have long been targets for policy intervention, existing approaches draw on a limited range of perspectives from the social sciences. Reflecting on our work with four non-academic partners (Defra, BEIS, FSA, Waterwise), we consider how social practice and geographies of household sustainability research might be combined with the dictum of “nexus thinking” to re-imagine the framing of policy and intervention to reduce the resource intensity of everyday life. Synthesising existing “home practices” literature in the context of the “live” policy problems raised by our partners, we seek to provide clear guidance for intervening in kitchen practices. We draw on one topic which has not yet been the subject of social practices research: fats, oils and grease (FOG) going down the kitchen plughole and contributing to widespread sewer blockages. In doing so we document the sequence of interrelated food provisioning activities through which WEF is put to use in domestic kitchens and contributes to FOG blockages in sewers. We reflect upon the multiple ways these practices are shaped by the rhythms of daily life, dynamics within the home, wider cultural conventions, and infrastructures. This paper contributes to the nascent transdisciplinary research agenda of translating home practices research into wider conceptualisations of “intervention,” with a specific orientation towards academic and non-academic stakeholders who are interested in influencing systems of sustainable consumption and production within, and across, the WEF sectors.

However, their performance can be often site-specific, depending on soil characteristics and agronomic practices, warranting site-specific model validations. Thus, in this study, we 1) validated the wind erodible fraction (WEF) predictive equations by Fryrear et al. (1994) and López et al. (2007) and 2) estimated the total soil loss with the Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program (SWEEP) using 3-yr measured data from six experiments located across a precipitation gradient in the central Great Plains. Each site had three corn (Zea mays L.) residue removal treatments: control (no removal), grazed, and baled. The measured and predicted WEF were significantly correlated. While the Fryrear et al. (1994) equation performed better than the López et al. (2007) equation, it underestimated WEF with 59% uncertainty across site-years. To reduce this underestimation and uncertainty, we developed a new statistical equation (WEF% = 84.3 + 2.64 × % silt-0.30 × % clay-7.43 × % organic matter-0.15 × % residue cover; r2 = 0.56). The predictive ability of the new equation was, however, no better than that of the existing predictive equations, suggesting the need for further refinement of WEF equations for the region. Simulated total soil loss by wind using the SWEEP model indicated that corn residue baling may increase soil loss if residue cover drops below 20% in the study region. Overall, the existing WEF equations could under- or over-estimate WEF based on site-specific residue management, warranting further model refinement and site-specific validation, whereas the SWEEP estimated soil loss corroborates the critical importance of maintaining sufficient residue cover (&gt;20%) to reduce wind erosion. © 2019",,"Agricultural wastes; Erosion; Agronomic practices; Central Great Plains; Precipitation gradients; Predictive abilities; Predictive equations; Simplified equations; Soil characteristics; Statistical equations; Soils; agricultural management; crop residue; environmental gradient; maize; model validation; precipitation (climatology); prediction; scenario analysis; soil erosion; uncertainty analysis; wind erosion; Great Plains; Zea mays",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus

The proposed model could help decision makers to identify the optimal production scales of food and energy production, the potential of water conservation of food production, as well as the investment portfolio of water-saving engineering.

The observed counter equatorial electrojet associated with late reversal of night-time westward electric field (WEF) shows inverse relationship with increasing solar activity and those that are not associated to late reversal of night-time WEF seems to indicate linear relationship exception of deep minimum solar activity year (2008). We also observed a gradual shift of ECEJ to the morning sector with increasing solar activity. Throughout the years, days with stronger morning counter equatorial electrojet magnitudes generally weaken the expected strong eastward current and shifted its peak to earlier local time. The annual and seasonal variations of SqH show semiannual variation with equinoctial maxima and solstitial minima. About 40% of the SqH shows positive night-time to pre-sunrise variations which suggest the existence of weak electric currents not necessarily of ionospheric origin with appreciable influence at this longitude sector.

The period analysed was 2014–2016, and the forecast horizon was 24 h in 4-h steps. The Random Forest (RF) machine-learning technique was used, with three sets of inputs: i) the electricity generated at Mutriku, ii) the wave energy flux (WEF) prediction made by the ECMWF wave model at Mutriku's nearest gridpoint, and iii) ocean and atmospheric data for the Bay of Biscay. For this last input, extended empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were calculated to reduce the dimensionality of these data, while retaining most of the information.

In this study, key components were identified from the perspective of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, and a WEF nexus model was established for the Upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB), taking into consideration the benefits of water supply to the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River, food growth in major food-producing areas in the UYRB and hydropower utilization of the UYR reservoir system. The Multi-start Solver of LINGO and the ε constraint method were used to carry out multi-objective optimization, revealing the trade-off between the WEF benefits. 1) The model computed the Pareto non-inferior set of solutions for the electricity generated by the UYR reservoir system and the degree to which the water demands of the main intake areas (Ningxia and Inner Mongolia irrigated areas, and Toudaoguai section) are satisfied, quantifying the improvement room for the overall benefits brought about by the jointly optimal operation of the WEF sectors. 2) The historical operation of Longyangxia Reservoir, a multi-year storage reservoir, was evaluated, the results of which show that the realization of the WEF benefits is determined by the proper operation of Longyangxia Reservoir. To guarantee the overall benefits in the long term, Longyangxia Reservoir should maintain a high water level. 3) The trade-offs between the WEF benefits under different boundary conditions were discussed, including various initial/final fore-bay water levels of Longyangxia Reservoir and inflows of various total water amounts from the headwater region of the UYRB. The research reveals the WEF nexus in the UYRB under different scenarios, and moreover, the formulated multi-objective optimization model is a good example that can be extended to other similar WEF nexus systems worldwide. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-objective optimization; Reservoir system; Upper Yellow River; Water-energy-food nexus","Economic and social effects; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Water levels; Water supply; Watersheds; Different boundary condition; Epsilon-constraint method; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimal operation; Reservoir systems; Storage reservoirs; Upper yellow rivers; Water energy; Multiobjective optimization; headwater; hydroelectric power; optimization; reservoir; runoff; water level; water supply; Article; electricity; energy yield; food availability; food industry; hydropower; priority journal; process optimization; river basin; socioeconomics; statistical model; water availability; water flow; water supply; China; Yellow River Basin",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

This research is focused on how this innovation adoption path is linked to economic growth of nations since the previous IT revolution has been combined with existing industries and adding values in terms of applying intelligence through adopting digital technologies. Approach/Design/Methodology: There are two different approaches-process approach and factor approach-in innovation adoption research. Innovation diffusion research, which is one of the process approaches, is related to adoption, diffusion, and impact theories, but there are limitations in explaining the perspective of a nation other than individual and organization on the basis of previous literatures. Therefore, we build the integrative model to verify innovative growth path of nations by applying Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DoI) and Technology (T)-Organization (O)-Environment (E) framework, which can explain factors of affecting innovation. We evaluate eight hypotheses with data collected from 137 to 212 nations using international information index by credible organizations: World Economic Forum (WEF),World Bank, United Nations (UN), and International Communications Union (ITU), based on the integrative model we proposed. The path analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is performed, and the result shows that the path from technological innovation capabilities (T), human capital (O), and environment (E) is related directly to economic impact, except for the path from human capital to value chain breadth directly and indirectly. The indirect path through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) access, use, and value chain helps to understand the full impact of digital innovation. Practical implications: By verifying this relationship, we expect to give suggestions in policy perspective and in building strategy towards innovative growth of countries. Our results show that technological innovation capabilities take time to show impact in terms of economic growth than the other factors, which are human capital, and political and regulatory environment of country. The nurture of human capital directly affects to the economic growth of nations relative to other T and E factors. The political and regulatory environment support stable ICT usage, which gives impact to the economic growth of nations. © 2019 by the authors.","Diffusion of Innovation (DoI); Digital innovation; Economic impact; Innovation adoption; Innovative growth; Path analysis; Technology diffusion; Technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

Resource scarcity has direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human health, and well-being of mostly poor rural communities. Climate change impacts in the region are manifesting through low crop yields, upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). This study applied a water–energy–food (WEF) nexus analytical livelihoods model with complex systems understanding to assess rural livelihoods, health, and well-being in southern Africa, recommending tailor-made adaptation strategies for the region aimed at building resilient rural communities. The WEF nexus is a decision support tool that improves rural livelihoods through integrated resource distribution, planning, and management, and ensures inclusive socio-economic transformation and development, and addresses related sustainable development goals, particularly goals 2, 3, 6 and 7. The integrated WEF nexus index for the region was calculated at 0.145, which is marginally sustainable, and indicating the region’s exposure to vulnerabilities, and reveals a major reason why the region fails to meet its developmental targets. The integrated relationship among WEF resources in southern Africa shows an imbalance and uneven resource allocation, utilisation and distribution, which normally results from a ‘siloed’ approach in resource management. The WEF nexus provides better adaptation options, as it guides decision making processes by identifying priority areas needing intervention, enhancing synergies, and minimising trade-offs necessary for resilient rural communities. Our results identified (i) the trade-offs and unintended negative consequences for poor rural households’ livelihoods of current silo approaches, (ii) mechanisms for sustainably enhancing household water, energy and food security, whilst (iii) providing direction for achieving SDGs 2, 3, 6 and 7. © 2019 by the authors.

An experiment platform was established to test the WEF performance with the consideration of three transmission ratios and two kinds of wind turbines with 3 and 5 blades. Results showed that the transmission ratio has a pronounced influence on the fan air volume and should be selected to obtain the rated air volume. The wind turbine with 3 blades is easier to start and its air volume is also 5.43%–17.85% more than that with 5 blades.

The perfect matching problem is to decide if G has such a matching. Recently Rothvoß proved the striking result that the Edmonds’ matching polytope has exponential extension complexity. In this paper for each n=|V| we describe a polytope for the perfect matching problem that is different from Edmonds’ polytope and define a weaker notion of extended formulation. We show that the new polytope has a weak extended formulation (WEF) Q of polynomial size. For each graph G with n vertices we can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting linear program over Q decides whether or not G has a perfect matching. With this construction, a straightforward O(n4) implementation of Edmonds’ matching algorithm using O(n2) bits of space would yield a WEF Q with O(n6logn) inequalities and variables. The construction is uniform in the sense that, for each n, a single polytope is defined for the class of all graphs with n nodes. The method extends to solve polynomial time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem. In this case a logarithmic (in the weight of the optimum solution) number of optimizations are made over the constructed WEF. The method described in the paper involves the construction of a compiler that converts an algorithm given in a prescribed pseudocode into a polytope. It can therefore be used to construct a polytope for any decision problem in P which can be solved by a well defined algorithm. Compared with earlier results of Dobkin–Lipton–Reiss and Valiant our method allows the construction of explicit linear programs directly from algorithms written for a standard register model, without intermediate transformations. We apply our results to obtain polynomial upper bounds on the non-negative rank of certain slack matrices related to membership testing of languages in P/POLY. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extended formulation; Extension complexity; Linear programming; Non-negative rank; Perfect matching; Polytopes","Linear programming; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Polynomial approximation; Extended formulations; Extension complexity; Non negatives; Perfect matchings; Polytopes; Graph theory",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus

Wild edible fungi (WEF) are frequently collected, sold, and consumed by households because of their high nutritional and economic value. Rational utilisation of WEF is imperative in balancing ecological protection and household livelihood development. Most existing studies concerning NTFPs or WEF utilisation combine collecting, selling, and reselling behaviours, but few studies focus on single behaviours, such as selling, that provide direct household income. Based on questionnaire survey data obtained from 193 households that collect WEF in nearby forests in the Wanzhou district of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, this study employed a logistic regression model to analyse the factors determining whether households sold the WEF they had collected. Results indicated that the decision to sell WEF was influenced by the amount of WEF collected, mastery of market information, distance from residence to main roadside selling points, and household income. Education, number of women in the household, and distance from collection points to residence were not influential. Based on the findings, this study suggests that implementing changes to the WEF market and local forest management system could improve household livelihood and reduce area poverty by enabling efficient use of WEF to generate greater sales revenue. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Household behaviour; Household livelihood; Non-timber forest products; Wild edible fungi","Commerce; Economic analysis; Fungi; Regression analysis; Sales; Surveys; Timber; Edible fungus; Forest management systems; Household behaviour; Household livelihood; Logistic Regression modeling; Non-timber forest products; Questionnaire surveys; Three gorges reservoir area; Forestry; edible species; forest management; fungus; household income; livelihood; logistics; nontimber forest product; poverty; questionnaire survey; Commerce; Economic Analysis; Fungi; Regression Analysis; Sales; Surveys; China; Chongqing; Three Gorges Reservoir; Wanzhou; Fungi",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

MC-IoT refers to systems which exacerbate properties like availability, reliability, safety, and security in an application environment of heterogeneously connected physical things and virtual things whose failure could lead to severe consequences such as life loss. The sole characteristic of the mission-critical system is its compliance with real-time behavior. As a result of the critical nature of these systems, it is essential to design the system with sufficient clarity so that none of the requirements is misinterpreted. For this, the involvement of non-technical stakeholders and policymakers is crucial. Previous studies on mission-critical structures mainly focus on the communication overheads, and overlook the design and planning of them. Therefore, in this paper, we present an architecture which enables mission planning on a do-it-yourself plane. We present a task-object mapping and deployment model where different tasks are mapped onto virtual objects and deployed on physical hardware in a task-object pair. The system uses semantic knowledge for autonomous task mapping and suggestions to further aid the orchestration of the process. The tasks are autonomously mapped onto the devices based on the correlation index; this is computed based on the attribute similarities, thus making the system flexible. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated with different key performance indicators under different load conditions and the response time is found to be under a few seconds even at peak load conditions. © 2019 by the authors.","Do-It-Yourself; Embedded devices; Internet of Things; Mission-Critical Systems; Smart space; Task mapping","architectural design; artificial intelligence; autonomy; communication network; compliance; hardware; mapping method; sustainable development; World Wide Web",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

However, watershed-based WF assessments are more appropriate for large-scale water resources management beyond the farm boundaries. In this study, blue, green and grey WF information, using the Water Footprint Network approach up to farm gate level, was determined for an apple (Malus pumila) orchard growing under Mediterranean climate conditions in South Africa. WF blue and WF green were determined through measurements of transpiration, total evaporation, rainfall, irrigation and other operational water uses, and WF grey was calculated from fertilizer applications. Combined field-scale blue/green/grey water footprint data were extrapolated to watershed scale by means of representative monthly FAO-56 type reference potential evaporation (ET o ) values and crop coefficients derived from the field scale observations. Resultant water use values were converted to a volumetric equivalent by multiplying by the area under apple orchards in each watershed. The volumetric equivalents were then summed for all QCs in the Water Management Area to calculate the overall water footprint for apple production in the basin. Orchard-scale WF, taking into account all water uses and a fruit yield of 61.5 t.ha −1 , was 212.1 m 3 . t −1 , comprising 62.7% WF blue , 14.9% WF green and 22.5% WF grey . Irrigation thus contributed the bulk of the WF in the apple production chain. Resultant water productivity (WP) figures for the orchard averaged 4.72 kg.m¯³. Scaling up the WF estimates to QC level gave an average value of 228.4 m 3 . t −1 (WP = 4.41 kg.m¯³).

For this purpose, we analyze the PES scheme implemented in the Hidrosogamoso hydropower project in Colombia. The paper shows that actors' strongly divergent economic and political power is determinant in defining how and for whom the Nexus-related water, food, and energy securities are materialized. In this case, the PES scheme and its scalar politics, as fostered by the private/public hydropower alliance, are instrumental to guaranteeing water security for the hydropower scheme, which is a crucial building-block of Colombia's energy security discourse. For this, the water and food securities of the adjacent, less powerful communities are sacrificed. Examining the on-the-ground politics of WEF Nexus is key to understanding their impact on equitable and sustainable governance of water, energy, and food in the everyday lives of millions of resource users.

To further the conceptualization and analysis of the Urban Nexus, this research introduces the theoretical perspective of networks and flows as developed in sociology by Manuel Castells. It offers a set of concepts to analyze how networks of WEF integrate or fail to do so, what the main actors are in connecting and configuring WEF networks, and how they interact. Method: We analyze how the structure and function and power dynamics of networks play out in the WEF Nexus. We use the city of Amsterdam as a case study because this city offers examples of how networks of provisioning are being integrated in innovate ways. Results: Amsterdam managed to realize a certain level of nexus dynamics in its existing WEF networks. The nexus in Amsterdam so far has materialized at a start-up or experimental level which proved feasible for trying out innovative approaches towards sustainability in interconnected flows of WEF.

First, an index system for assessing coupling and coordination degrees of the core WEF nexus was built. Second, the development levels of three subsystems as well as the coupling and coordination degrees of the core WEF nexus in China were calculated. The results showed that from 2007 to 2016, the mean value of the coupling degree was 0.746 (range (0.01, 1)), which was a high level. This proved that the three resources were interdependent. Hence, it was necessary to study their relationship. However, the mean value of the coordination degree was 0.395 (range (0, 1)), which was a low level. This showed that the coordination development of the core WEF nexus in China was low. It is necessary to take some measures to improve the situation.

The results show that in terms of goals the Nexus Approaches are very similar to Integrated Management Approaches with the addition of clearly wanting to address governance and policy aspects e.g. in the WEF Nexus. Nexus Approaches try to move away from a single-resource centric view (e.g. WSW Nexus) and intend to go beyond resources towards sectors (e.g. WEF Nexus). It cannot be confirmed, that integration is clearly addressed in the analysed Integrated Management Approaches and what integration means is hardly defined.

As we head into a new era of civilization, population increase and modernized lifestyles have led to an increasing need for water, energy, and food. However, severe hydrological precipitation significantly impacts agricultural harvest, and such influence becomes more apparent under the influence of climate change. Meanwhile, the major method of electricity generation (i.e., fossil fuel burning) has a negative impact on the environment. These inevitable threats are crucial and have to be dealt with for a society on the road towards sustainability. In the present study, an integrated evaluation of the WEF nexus was conducted for two areas with different levels of urbanization using empirical multiple linear regression in a simultaneous equation model (SEM). By incorporating the collected data into the SEM, the weighting coefficient of each identified variable was obtained, and the nexus implication was assessed in model simulation at different scenarios considering the population growth, agro-technology advancement, energy structure improvement, and available water resources. In the simulated results, three observations were found: (1) the rural area is more sustainable than the urban one; (2) the sustainability for both the investigated areas is significantly subject to their water supply and demand; and (3) food production was found to have a less important effect on the sustainable development of the urban area. This study identified the key factors in the WEF nexus exploration, which are economically and environmentally important for resource allocation.

Sustainable governance of Water–Energy–Food (WEF) requires innovative and cross-sectorial systems of provisioning. However, practitioners have often treated WEF as separate domains, while ignoring their interconnectedness. What is missing is an ‘Urban Nexus’ perspective, which assumes that environmental flows of WEF interact and relate to one another in achieving urban sustainable development. This paper contributes to theorizing the urban nexus and to understand its emergence and governance from a more socio-material perspective. It offers a conceptual framework that helps to shed light on the social and material flows shaping connections between the sectors of WEF, and the actors facilitating these connections. The paper suggests that switchers and programmers link and configure the socio-material flows of WEF facilitating the emergence of nexus governance networks and nexus programs. In doing so, the paper provides three examples of cities to test the conceptual framework by analyzing their main challenges and examples around the nexus. It demonstrates that material and social dimensions of WEF might not play an equal role in steering synergies or trade-offs—either material or social flows and their agents can be central in facilitating a nexus or in preventing it to take shape. The paper argues that material-focused methodologies need to be complemented with a social flows analysis that pays attention to the daily practice, policies, ideologies, networks or any kind of socio-cultural meaning shaping WEF provisioning. © 2018, The Author(s).","Environmental flows; Networks; Urban governance; Urban nexus; Water–Energy–Food",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Please find the Literature Review text as follows: Literature review: Women's political representation in Indonesia has been steady and meagre, since the fall of Suharto's New Order regime in 1998 (see Table 1). As a means to improving women's parliamentary representation, quotas have become a part of the Indonesian electoral landscape, succeeding an international trend where rapid growth took place in the vast majority of democracies (Dahlerup, 2006b; Rosen, 2017). The government passed a bill in 2003 which requires parties to nominate at least 30% female candidates (Siregar, 2005). This intervention had some level of success, as the highest gender ratio took place in 2009 with 102 out of 560 elected MPs being women. However, in the 2014 elections, despite stronger regulations in gender quotas and an increase in the number of female candidates, the result was a slight decrease (Hillman, 2017). These patterns are common in the quota literature, which points to the importance of quota design, implementation and enforcement in ensuring representative outcomes (Dahlerup, 2006a; Kenny & Verge, 2016; M. L. Krook, 2009). To explain these dynamics of electing women into parliament, the current paper explores women's electoral success from the nomination stage to the election results. A growing body of research suggests female candidates' performance at the polling stations depends on voters' socioeconomic status, institutional aspects, and candidates' internal and external factors. The following section provides elaboration on each of these variables. Voters' socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic factors are often suggested as stimulating the supply of highly qualified women for political positions as economic development brings about a decline in traditional values as well as fertility rates (Kenworthy & Malami, 1999; Kunovich & Paxton, 2005; Paxton, 1997) and enables women to attain higher education and to participate in the workforce (Togeby, 1994). In their seminal book Rising tide, Inglehart and Norris (2003) argue countries with different levels of societal modernisation show contrasting egalitarian levels, in particular when looking at male and female roles in politics. Agrarian nations are considered as the most traditional and sex roles are deeply divided. In contrast, post-industrial societies are the most egalitarian in their beliefs about the roles of men and women, thus accepting women as much as they accept men being political leaders. Modernisation, a transition from an agrarian to a post-industrial society, should lead to a higher representation of women in elected positions (Inglehart, Norris, & Welzel, 2002). Economic development, as Rosen (2013) argues, should foster the election of women in two ways. First there is supply of competent female candidates to be chosen for elected office. For example, in highly educated geographical units, women are professionally active in two pools from which candidates and elected representatives are chosen: lawyers and teachers (Hill, 1981). In addition, with higher development there should also be higher demand for the inclusion of women in positions of power. In particular, women who take on important professional and associational positions also strive for political representation. Jayweera (1997) argues that economic development and improved women's status has little impact when it comes to gender equality in Asia. This argument received support as, in Indonesia, women's share in the decision making process (i.e. parliament) remains a stumbling block for equal representation despite a significant increase in GDP per capita (World Bank, 2018) and that gender inequality has declined in primary school enrolment and labor participation (WEF, 2017). This paper aims to test the connection between voters' socioeconomic status and electing women into parliament. Do regions with higher class status tend to vote for more women than the poorer areas? Independent variables for this aspect include consumption per capita per month, poverty rate, life expectancy, years of schooling, and the Human Development Index (HDI). District magnitudes: The literature on political institutional variables (i.e. closed lists, district magnitude, gender quotas, and placement mandates) are widely thought to facilitate the election of women in list PR systems (Schmidt, 2009). Studies suggest countries with party-list proportional representation (PR) electoral systems (Ballington, 1998; Luhiste, 2015; Tremblay, 2005) and gender quotas have a significantly higher proportion of women in parliament (Dahlerup & Freidenvall, 2005; M. Krook & Messing-Mathie, 2013; Tinker, 2004). Gender quotas in Indonesia were first introduced in Indonesia with Law No. 31 of 2002 on Political Parties. It encourages parties to have at least 30% of a party's board being women. The Indonesian Elections Commission's (KPU) Regulation No. 7/2013 and Law No. 8/2012 on General Elections stated parties must nominate candidates with at least 30% being female using the zipper system (one female in each three nominees) or be disqualified to run. However, gender quotas, clearly, has yet delivered expected outcomes as the increase in the number of female candidates is accompanied by a decline in women's electoral performance (Górecki & Kukołowicz, 2014). Scholars also suggest with larger district magnitudes than other systems (Norris, 2004) women are more likely to win. Once listed as candidates, women's position in the ballot structure is critical as under the open-list system their chances of winning is subject to their number on the aspirants' list (Paxton, Kunovich, & Hughes, 2007). The number of seats per district, also known as district magnitudes, under PR systems encourages the nomination and election of more female candidates (Kostadinova, 2007; Matland, 1998). This positive effect is taking place in Singapore, where multi-member seats have facilitated the inclusion of not only minority ethnic groups, but also women (Tan, 2014). Indonesia had 77 electoral districts for the 2014 legislative elections. The number of seats assigned to a district, ranging from three to 10, is determined by population. A study by Choi (2010) suggests from 1999 to 2009 Indonesia's electoral reform reduced district magnitude. According to the institutional literature on party systems, when district magnitude decreases, the seat-winning threshold increases, thus supposedly creating a smaller number of political parties per district. Yet, the effective number of political parties in Indonesia increased over time. This paper observes the impact of different district magnitudes on women's political nomination; whether women are more likely to be elected in electorates with more seats. In addition to that, this paper also looks into the correlation between turnout (in percentage) and women's electability. Is higher turnout translated into more women being elected as deputies? Candidates' internal characteristics: Recruitment to legislative office is one of the core functions of political systems, yet the selection of candidates often takes place far away from public scrutiny (Lundell, 2004; Norris & Lovenduski, 1995). In their book Candidate selection in comparative perspective, Gallagher and Marsh (1988) suggest the quality of candidates selected determines the quality the deputies elected and sometimes also of a country's politics. Candidates' nomination reflects political parties' priorities and strategies in winning legislative elections, thus, it is important to observe who are being nominated and where they are listed on the party tickets. Literature on political elites has long examined social backgrounds, paths to power, and political ambition among representatives (Schwindt-Bayer, 2011), yet very little of it focuses on developing countries, especially Asia (Joshi & Och, 2014). In this study, candidates' internal characteristics being observed include incumbency, age, professional background, education, marital status, and province of residence. An incumbency advantage seems widespread in legislative elections, where parties nominate more women in districts with incumbent females, and female candidates perform better with the presence of an incumbent female (Shair-Rosenfield, 2012). Another study on Indonesia asserts incumbency offers a consistent advantage to candidates for legislative elections, male and female, as incumbents are better positioned to distribute resources to build up their network (Dettman, Pepinsky, & Pierskalla, 2017). In many countries elected MPs are dominated by rather wealthy and educated middle-aged to senior men of the dominant ethnicity. According to Norris (1997, p. 6), “legislatures world-wide include more of the affluent than the less well-off, more men than women, more middle-aged than young, and more white-collar professionals than blue-collar workers”. An experimental study on Indonesia suggests young voters share a similar preference with older groups when it comes to electing female deputies (Prihatini, 2018). Aside from the lack of women, representation of age groups in national parliaments also raises an issue. Stockemer and Sundström (2018) argue political institutions matter and giving candidates the right to stand in elections as early as possible (i.e. at the age of 18) will increase the percentage of young deputies elected. To check the conformity of this body of literature with the Indonesian context, this paper examines whether candidates' characteristics explain overall and female candidates' electoral success. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,"English",Erratum,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

As a result, 87 representative factors have been identified and classified, with a hierarchy structure established by ISM. Based on the relative importance of given factors, factor hierarchy structure shows that the energy system in the core nexus is the essential system and is critical to promoting the WEF-nexus in Beijing; factors from peripheral nexuses – such as population and vehicle volume – also have a significant influence on nexus governance. Furthermore, integrated policies from subsystems within the core nexus or between the core and peripheral nexuses are critical to secure WEF in Beijing. Factor analysis suggests that the portrayed nexus structure could provide valuable references for further quantification and decision making. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Hierarchy structure; ISM; Sustainable development; Water-energy-food nexus","Decision making; Multivariant analysis; Sustainable development; Complex relationships; Energy systems; Hierarchy structure; Interpretive structural modeling; Water energy; Factor analysis; decision making; hierarchical system; modeling; sustainable development; article; China; decision making; factor analysis; human; hydropower; sustainable development; tight junction; catering service; energy resource; factor analysis; theoretical model; water supply; Beijing [China]; China; Beijing; Energy-Generating Resources; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Food Supply; Models, Theoretical; Water Supply",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

A methodology for drawing the interrelations among the five dimensions and unreeling the complicated system of direct and indirect interlinkages is given. The intensity of interlinkages among nexus components is initially assessed through a three-point typology with interlinkage scoring corresponding to resource use in Greece. The typology is used and is further expanded to quantify successfully all interlinkages among nexus components with a proposed heuristic algorithm. Results are used to create the cross-interlinkage matrix that identifies food as the most influencing resource and water as the resource mostly influenced by other nexus elements.

The lack of nexus applications in policy and decision making can be related to numerous factors, with the main barrier being the complex nature of “nexus” systems combined with the disarray of tools attempting to model its interconnections. The paper aims to provide a method for comparing the perceived complexity of nexus tools identified by international organizations as well as primary literature sources. Eight separate criteria are introduced and discussed as measures of a tool “complexity index” and used to score the relative simplicity, or complexity, of a given tool. The result of this process is used to identify trends within existing nexus-assessment tools while guiding potential users towards appropriate tool(s) best-suited for their case study needs and objectives. The main objectives of this paper are to: 1) categorize nexus assessment tools according to a criteria-set which allows for suitable tool selection; 2) identify a method for rapid evaluation of the trade-offs for choosing different tools (simple-complex spectrum). The results of the comparative analysis of the selected nexus assessment tools concur with literature citing a growing gap between nexus research and applications in actual policy and decision-making settings. Furthermore, results suggest that tools receiving higher complexity scores, while being able to capture details to specific resource interactions, are unable to cover a larger number of interactions and system components simultaneously, as compared to lower complexity score tools. Lastly, the outcome of the analysis point towards the need for integrating more preliminary assessment capabilities, i.e. diagnostics, guidelines, and capacity building, into existing tools that improve the communication and translation of model outputs into policy and decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Context specific tools; Decision support; Nexus tools; Resource management; Tool complexity","Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Comparative analysis; Decision supports; International organizations; Preliminary assessment; Research and application; Resource management; Resources planning; Specific tool; Decision making; comparative study; complexity; decision making; decision support system; policy approach; trade-off; water management; water planning; water resource; article; capacity building; decision support system; hydropower; outcome assessment; practice guideline; resource management; tight junction; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; food; food chain; procedures; software; water; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Food; Food Chain; Software; Water",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Such a paradigm could be anchored in addressing water, energy and food security from a nexus perspective if such a security concept is appropriately defined and operationalized. To develop the argument, governance challenges arising from the different logics of the concepts of water, energy and food security are addressed with a definition for WEF security from a nexus perspective. An analytical framework using a network and ecosystem services perspective is introduced. The power of the approach introduced is illustrated for a typical case to identify coordination failures and persistent sustainability problems but as well leverage points for transformative change.

This reflects an overall projection, but the challenge will affect various regions of the state differently. Texas has 16 regional water planning zones characterized by distinct populations, water demands, and existing water supplies. Each is expected to face variations of pressures, such as increased agricultural and energy development (particularly hydraulic fracturing) and urban growth that do not necessarily follow the region's water plan. Great variability in resource distribution and competing resource demands across Texas will result in the emergence of distinct hotspots, each with unique characteristics that require multiple, localized, interventions to bridge the statewide water gap. This study explores three such hotspots: 1) water-food competition in Lubbock and the potential of producing 3 billion gallons of treated municipal waste water and encouraging dryland agriculture; 2) implementing Low Impact Developments (LIDs) for agriculture in the City of San Antonio, potentially adding 47 billion gallons of water supply, but carrying a potentially high financial cost; and 3) water-energy interrelations in the Eagle Ford Shale in light of well counts, climate dynamics, and population growth. The growing water gap is a state wide problem that requires holistic assessments that capture the impact on the tightly interconnected water, energy, and food systems. Better understanding the trade-offs associated with each 'solution’ and enabling informed dialogue between stakeholders, offers a basis for formulating localized policy recommendations specific to each hotspot. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment tools; Holistic assessment; Localized solutions; Trade-offs; WEF Nexus Analytics","Agriculture; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; Urban growth; Wastewater treatment; Water supply; Assessment tool; Holistic assessment; Localized solutions; Trade off; WEF Nexus Analytics; Water treatment; ground water; surface water; well water; water; holistic approach; policy approach; resource assessment; resource development; trade-off; water demand; water planning; water supply; agriculture; aquifer; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; energy cost; energy resource; environmental sustainability; fracking; population growth; priority journal; resource allocation; spatiotemporal analysis; Texas; waste water management; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; water availability; water conservation; water quality; water supply; city; environmental protection; food; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Texas; water supply; San Antonio; Texas; United States; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food; Texas; Water; Water Supply",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Peru’s capital, Lima, was selected as a case study due to its ever-growing population necessitating a more inclusive approach to managing scarce natural resources within and outside the city. Policies have been developed to enhance water, energy and food security in Lima, but their effectiveness has never been evaluated. Using data from interviews with key stakeholders, the chapter assesses the success of the nexus integration into Lima’s environmental governance. Findings indicate limited integration, as policy implementation is not appropriately supported on the ground, that is at the level of practitioners/actors who operationalise policy decisions. The chapter shows that Peru’s environmental governance prioritises short-term economic gains over long-term environmental and social sustainability of local communities. It is therefore critical, in addition to improving the nexus integration into Lima’s and national environmental policies, to introduce a system monitoring of the effectiveness of policy implementation.

Comprehensively considering the water–energy–food nexus as well as the external environment, this study adopts a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling evaluation method to assess the agricultural production efficiency (APE) of seven provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR) during 1996–2015. The results show that the three-stage DEA modelling evaluation method reveals real APE and is considered to be a better quantitative method than conventional approaches. A gradually widening range of APE is an important challenge for this region. Significantly, this region generates huge demands for agricultural resources. Moreover, regional emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) decreased from 34.20 million tons standard coal in 1996 to 32.11 million tons standard coal in 2015, though APE has continued to decrease by 2.56% in the past two decades. In general, the management and technology levels should be improved simultaneously, even though specific opportunities for APE improvement vary across provinces in MLYR. However, understanding the temporal and spatial variation of APE along with the WEF nexus from a production-based insight is a vital step toward appropriately targeted policy making for nationwide resources savings and emissions reduction. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Agricultural production efficiency (APE); Malmquist index; Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLYR); Resources saving and emissions reduction; Three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling evaluation method; Water–energy–food (WEF) nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Due to increasing demands for natural resources, the WEF nexus has emerged as a response to the numerous global challenges. Addressing WEF challenges often involves balancing multiple and competing priorities and identifying and managing interrelations, synergies and trade-offs between the three components of the nexus. In this volume the authors focus on the dynamics between multiple stakeholders, such as governments, businesses, NGOs and local communities, when addressing WEF challenges by adopting a nexus approach. The book argues that effective engagement of multiple stakeholders can address difficulties arising from the introduction of an integrated approach to WEF policy design and implementation, increasing the potential benefits. The book also looks at the effect of international relations and regional power struggles on resolving cross-border WEF nexus issues. Case studies are drawn from Kenya, Central Asia, USA and Peru, highlighting key themes, such as how collaborative governance, enabled and facilitated by relational equity management, can be viewed as an innovative way to reconcile competing priorities.

Drawing on field data, the chapter uses the dual analytical lens of collaborative governance and relational equity to discuss the interlinkages between WEF nexus governance and security. The analysis shows that a State-centric, unidimensional security conceptualisation hinders collaborative governance, impeding stakeholder involvement and disregarding the critical significance of effective nexus governance for human security. The chapter further demonstrates the benefits of a relational equity approach to collaborative governance, highlighting the detrimental impact of disregarding key stakeholders’ expectations, needs and objectives.

Contact center and customer service solutions are critical communication services in the modern digital society. Digital society is highly dependent on customer service, be it digital, self-service or traditional phone service. Communication services and platforms are also an attractive target for nation-state cyber troops and criminals. Moreover, some of the cyber-attacks are specifically targeted to harm, steal and destruct critical customer data in the systems. These systems are also becoming more complex having more vulnerable components. Also, the service processes behind the services are becoming more complex with partners locating in another country. It is argued that risk analysis, risk management and business continuity management approaches are not sufficient to capture the complexities of uncontrolled, unexpected events. These approaches suit well in the foreseeable and calculable situations. They are not, however, sufficient to focus on increasing risks in the modern cyber-physical world having non-foreseeable, non-calculable stress situations. Thus, resilience must be built into the systems and it must have ownership, attention, proper ways to measure it and an interest to implement relevant metrics framework as a regular review. This study reviews briefly the frameworks of NIST, Linkov, and WEF and uses WEF to evaluate its applicability into real-life situation in a telecommunications service. The research question is how WEF framework can be applicable and possibly be improved as a tool of continuous review for business owners of communication platforms. The study uses case study method. The subject of the research is a particular case, a telecommunications company and a contact center solution.

Moreover, water is an important input for the economy and an indispensable factor for economic growth. Especially in regions that are facing water scarcity, the adoption of water management policies and approaches fostering the sustainable use of resources while promoting economic growth becomes an emerging issue. The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding the availability of water resources due to climate change and human activities. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus offers an integrated approach analyzing the synergies and trade-offs between the different sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources, whereas adapting optimum policies and institutional arrangements. The Mediterranean is a region where we observe a large spectrum of issues emanating from water pollution and natural resource degradation to water scarcity, large amounts of food loss and waste and increasing demand for energy and food. Agricultural practices, urban development, demand management for water, and protection of ecosystems, particularly aquatic ecosystems, are areas of particular intervention available to the decision-makers in enhancing availability of water for the various water using sectors. In this context, the current policy note paper aims to address a major issue: how can the implementation of the WEF Nexus support the economic growth in the Mediterranean? Based on the outcome of an experts and stakeholders regional workshop, this paper presents the current status, including the opportunities and the practices of applying the WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean and draws specific recommendations for the way forward. Regarding the later, the strengthening of WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean requires a set of interventions to strengthen the institutional capacities, to enhance the finance mechanisms, to support the intra-regional dialogue as well, to enhance data collection and management, as well as to implement economic instruments and integrated economic approaches to measure the impact of Nexus into economy and employment. © 2019 Markantonis, Reynaud, Karabulut, El Hajj, Altinbilek, Awad, Bruggeman, Constantianos, Mysiak, Lamaddalena, Matoussi, Monteiro, Pistocchi, Pretato, Tahboub, Tunçok, ünver, Van Ek, Willaarts, Bülent, Zakir and Bidoglio.","Economic growth; Economic instruments; Integrated approach; Mediterranean; Opportunities; Recommendations; Water policy; Water-Energy-Food Nexus",,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The method is based on the head-related transfer function (HRTF) database and the interaural transfer function (ITF) obtained from two measured input signals. An algorithm to reduce the effect of background noise on the localization performance in a noisy environment was adopted in the proposed localization method. Weighted error functions (WEFs), defined using the ITF and the ratio of HRTFs for two ears, were used with a special frequency weighting function derived to reduce the effect of noise and to render the WEF a hysical meaning. Computer simulations confirmed that the weighting function can effectively reduce the effect of background noise on the localization performance even if the noise power is very high. Localization tests in an actual room confirmed that both the azimuth and elevation angles of sound source can be estimated simultaneously with high accuracy. In particular, the front-back and up-down confusions, which are critical limitations for conventional localization methods, could be resolved using two input signals. © S.

The existence of cross-sectoral unintended effects in part reflects the prices’ inability to appropriately reflect costs and benefits, which leads to resource misallocation. The existence of negative externalities (e.g. the unintended and/or negative sectoral outcomes) necessitates regulation and policy intervention. Regulation may adjust relative prices and thereby align private and social costs. Numerous factors complicate such intervention, which the chapter discusses. Price mechanisms can therefore only partially guide policy makers and assist in coordinating development and activities in each sector. The chapter investigates how to operationalise integrated governance in the absence of coordination signals. Generally, prices are important components of behavioural incentive structures. Where property rights are appropriately delineated, transferred and enforced, price mechanisms regulate scarce resource usage. This chapter applies a comparative property rights analysis outlining the transferability and enforceability of sectoral/cross-sectoral property rights transfers. It illustrates the analysis by using natural resource management examples from Central Asia and Australia.

California’s recent emergence from an exceptional drought reinforced the urgency for action to ensure sustainable water resource management. The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus is highly visible in California’s Central Valley, where the state’s significant production in each WEF sector compete with production in two other sections, thus creating tensions and shared interests. For example, during the recent drought, farmers had to fallow land due to water shortages, whilst oil producers faced significant wastewater problems. Both sectors’ representatives consider re-using oilfield produced water (OPW) for agricultural irrigation as a win-win solution. However, scientists and environmentalists raise safety concerns. The chapter identifies different stakeholders’ views and interests, examines regulatory options available to the state, and analyses the medium-term effect of OPW use for crop irrigation on California’s water budget and climate change adaptation. It examines exacerbating factors (e.g. climate change, population growth) through the lens of relational equity management and its impact on the actors’ collaborative action.

Mpumalanga also possesses almost half of the country's high potential arable land. While South Africa is currently largely self-sufficient in terms of cereal grains, what this assessment of Mpumalanga highlights is that food security is increasingly being threatened by coal mining interests that serve the nation's energy needs. Water availability and quality for mining, agriculture and energy production in this province are also becoming increasingly strained. The water quality deterioration generally results from either acid mine drainage (AMD) or contaminated runoff from mines and agricultural lands.

This study presents a first attempt towards understanding the WEF nexus of urban environments in the Nile River Basin under conditions of hydrological droughts and fluvial floods. A case study was conducted for the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, at the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile for illustration. The results were based on analyses of river flow and water turbidity data, field observations, a printed questionnaire and an interview of farmers practicing irrigated agriculture, and hydropower modeling. The study analyzes indicators for the association of the river water resources environment (intra-annual regime, quantity, and quality), the status of urban irrigated agriculture, water treatment for domestic use, and hydropower generation under hydrological extremes, i.e. droughts and fluvial floods. It additionally examines the consequent interactions between the impacts on three sectors. The present study shows how floods and droughts impose impacts on seasonal river water quality and quantity, water treatment for domestic use, irrigated agriculture, and hydro-energy supply in an urban environment. The results demonstrate how the two hydrological phenomena determine the state of hydropower generation from dams, i.e. high energy production during floods and vice versa during droughts. Hydropower dams, in turn, could induce cons in the form of low fertile soils in the downstream due to sediment retention by the reservoir. Finally, present and potential options to minimize the above risks are discussed.

Modern-day waste management should also entail ways to benefit from this resource, not simply burying or burning it, as used to be the case. One promising technique is undoubtedly waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion. It offers an efficient means of managing waste that fits ideally with the needs of large population centers, while providing a source of alternative and renewable energy. In this context the objective of this chapter is to discuss how we may use various policy instruments to promote WTE to maximize its benefits to society. One interesting way to understand the relationship between waste and energy is to look at WTE through the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. The role of waste in the WEF nexus and how it can be enhanced through WTE and correct policy interventions are discussed in the first half of the chapter. For the ease of discussion, we have grouped the stakeholders into categories: manufacturers, consumers, collectors, operators, and policy makers/implementers. How policy instruments may assist us in promoting WTE is then discussed by taking five different examples: banning combustible waste from landfills, financial incentives to reduce the existing landfill footprint, WTE certificates, variable tax rates for different wastes, and the mandatory labeling of energy potential. While one of these instruments has already been implemented, the others are new or modified suggestions of policy instruments found in other disciplines. Where appropriate, these policy instruments are also elaborated using brief case studies. The implications for the environment are also discussed at the end of the chapter along two themes: WTE as a method of waste management and as a method of energy production. The carbon neutrality of WTE is a major strength, and from the sustainability point of view WTE is much more promising than landfilling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It demonstrates how nexus thinking has been embedded in policy-making and the extent of its adoption and success in pursuing sustainable food production and water management and increased utilisation of renewable energy. The chapter discusses the varying degrees of success of nexus approaches to agricultural policy-making at the three levels (national, regional and international) and considers achievements and failures through the lens of relational equity management.

Wastewater treatment plants cannot operate merely as disposal facilities any longer. Instead, water resource recovery must become a cornerstone of facility operation, producing water fit for purpose, recovering nutrients, and reducing fossil fuel consumption by recovering the energy inherent in wastewater. One of WEF's objective is to develop a program to set strategic resource recovery goals for the U.S. water sector. The first step of this effort is to establish a baseline for current resource recovery practices in the North American water sector, followed by quantifying and publicizing progress toward stated goals. This paper summarizes the current status quo of resource recovery at Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) in the U.S. for water, biosolids, nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen), and energy recovery.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) pointed out in ""The Future of Jobs Report 2018"" that the world is experiencing a ""workplace revolution"", which means that machine will play a more important role in the future. In response to this situation, in this paper, techniques for object recognition and tracking on a conveyor using eye-in-hand gripper are presented, which are useful in production line for automatic object classification. The eye-in-hand configuration is the most suitable for camera and gripper application because the camera coordinate is the same as the gripper coordinate. The main advantages of eye-in-hand configuration are as follow: (1) occlusion avoidance (2) intuitive teleoperation (3) image from different angles (4) simple calibration. The main difference with eye-on-hand configuration is that it may be out of view sight when the camera is too close to the object. The experimental result is using the eye-in-hand robotic gripper to establish a tracking system to chase the target object. Preliminary results show that the speed of the conveyor can be calculated and the moving distance between the robot and the object is very close after a period of time. It means that the tracking system is successful. © 2019 ASME.","Eye-in-hand; Image-based tracking control; Robotic gripper","Cameras; Computer vision; Conveyors; Grippers; Object recognition; Robotics; Tracking (position); Automatic object classification; Automation industry; Eye-in-hand; Hand configuration; Image based tracking; Industrial modeling; Robotic grippers; Tracking system; Palmprint recognition","Information Storage and Processing Systems Division","ASME 2019 28th Conference on Information Storage and Processing Systems, ISPS 2019","27 June 2019 through 28 June 2019",,155233,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

After almost 30 years using well-known International Water Association (IWA) models, should the community move to other components, processes, or model structures like 'black box' models, computational fluid dynamics techniques, etc.? Can new data sources - e.g. on-line sensor data, chemical and molecular analyses, new analytical techniques, off-gas analysis - keep up with the increasing process complexity? Are different methods for data management, data reconciliation, and fault detection mature enough for coping with such a large amount of information?

This concept draws attention to the link between different environmental and societal domains, and potentially entails substantive shifts in governance processes. As a consequence, policy-makers and scientists have started to develop metrics to make these interactions and ‘trade-offs’ visible. However, it is unknown if current framings of the nexus and relevant quantified metrics either reinforce or challenge existing governance structures. This paper explores relationships between framings of the nexus, metrics and models of governance based on discussions with staff within the European Commission. Although narratives around the need for new metrics are situated in a conventional script about the use of evidence to change policy, our data indicate processes of co-production, by which the use (or non-use) of any new metrics is dependent on existing institutional practices; and will reflect dominant political orderings. In doing so we provide a critical analysis of the role of metrics in environmental governance, and direct attention to the discursive, institutional and political arrangements in which they are embedded and with which they are co-constitutive. Focusing on the cultural and institutional settings in which they are established and used, our study suggests that the question of metrics in the water-energy-food nexus needs to be explored as a problem of establishing a legitimate policy objective in the European Commission and EU policy-making more broadly. © 2019","Co-production; Environmental governance; Legitimacy; Narrative; Quantification; Water-energy-food nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

As the ILO approaches its centenary, it is striking that only six women have served as President of its main governance body, the International Labour Conference, and that efforts are still needed internally to mainstream gender equality across the International Labour Office’s programming and internal processes and products. This chapter analyses how to overcome this invisibility through two prisms: (i) the importance of inclusion of women as international labour law makers (process) and (ii) the positive results of mainstreaming women and men’s equality in the international labour standards that govern the world of work (content).

Recent emerging biotechnologies, such as synthetic biology, gene editing and nano-biotechnology, as well as open source software and hardware, are concerned about the ease and sophistication of life manipulation and generation at low cost. These explosive synthetic biology and gene editing developments are also concerned with the possibility of dual use with biological weapons, which may be intentional or unintentional. The technological innovation of gene synthesis is rapidly advancing the synthetic biology that can dramatically reduce the costs and increase the accuracy and enable genome synthesis. Synthetic biology can revolutionize the function of living organisms by engineering and synthesizing genes as parts with one unit. The entire genome of the microbial organism was synthesized from small pieces, reaching the level at which other microorganisms were transferred and operated. Synthetic biology can be used to produce microorganisms that produce biofuels, medicines, or organic substances. On the other hand, the possibility of creating new pathogens with various risk characteristics as well as gain of function is increased for dual use. The research objective is to suggest the policy directions for risk management of emerging biotechnologies, including synthetic biology and gene editing and so on. The approach taken in this paper combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, such as bibliographic analysis, peer reviews and in-depth interviews. We analyzed the policy formation, policy implementation and policy coordination for risk management on emerging biotechnologies and suggested science and technology-based policy directions to increase resilience to risk management in these areas.

TF design is a major improvement over traditional methods and markedly improves the probability of good self-cleansing in gravity flow pipes. It is also a useful tool for evaluating existing sewers and drainage pipes. Fundamental open-channel hydraulic analysis provides the basic TF equation: τo = γRhS, where τo is average water shear stress acting on the wetted perimeter, γis the unit weight of water, Rh is the hydraulic radius, and S is the energy line slope (pipe slope for uniform flow.) When the critical shear, τc, needed to move a design particle is reached, the pipe self-cleanses by moving the design particle, and all smaller particles, down the pipe. A needed ""new"" variable is design minimum flowrate, Qmin, in each sewer reach - defined as the largest one-hour flowrate during the low flow week over the system design life. Selection of a design particle, usually a 1 mm sand particle for domestic sewage, determines the needed critical shear force, τc. The resulting pipe slope for self-cleansing, Smin is calculated from simultaneous equation solution or picked from tables or graphs. The TF approach presented herein generally gives design minimum slopes that are of about the same magnitude as used in traditional practice, but the approach is tailored specifically to the design low flows predicted for each sewer reach, thus giving a more consistent and accurate methodology for self-cleansing design. As compared to traditional values, Smin slopes via TF are flatter for smaller sewers carrying typical to larger Qmin values and steeper for larger sewers - the break point is at about 12 inch diameter. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Combined sewers; Drainage; Open channel flow; Pipelines; Sewage; Shear stress; Surveys; Domestic sewage; Hydraulic radius; Sand particles; Simultaneous equations; Solids transport; Tractive force; Traditional values; Wetted perimeters; Shear flow","Utility Engineering and Surveying Institute (UESI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASME)","Pipelines 2019 Conference: Multidisciplinary Topics, Utility Engineering, and Surveying","21 July 2019 through 24 July 2019",,149753,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

The WEF (water-energy-food) Nexus approach, which holistically considers the dynamic interlinkages between water, energy, and food resources, has come to the forefront within scientific and practice communities. Supporters assert that sustainable solutions can be revealed through the use of this approach, rather than conventional approaches that often overlook the interlinkages. The authors developed a holistic framework to provide sustainable scenarios that include feasible infrastructure interventions. The framework focuses on water and associated links with other resources, includes a unique analytic tool for quantifying scenarios, and ultimately produces a sustainability analysis of each scenario. Optimal scenarios are offered that consider site-specific dynamic resource interlinkages. The platform was applied to the case study of Matagorda County, Texas, identified as one of the most water-stressed regions in the state of Texas by the Texas Water Development Board, the state's executive agency for water resources management. High demands from energy and agriculture sectors in the county and sharp population increase in the upper basins, which include the city of Austin, have put great pressures on the water resources of Matagorda County. Farmers have been forced to change their crops from high to lower water-demand crops, in spite of apparent and relatively abundant local water resources. The findings of the case study present a most sustainable scenario, including infrastructure interventions that will increase the annual income of agriculture sector from $188 million to $239 million. The approach also helps preserve resources while reducing annual water and energy demand by 22 million m3 and 21 million kWh, respectively, and does not sacrifice on-going municipal and industrial water use or energy production in Matagorda, Texas. © 2019 Kulat, Mohtar and Olivera.","Infrastructure interventions; Interlinkages; Nexus modeling; Resource allocation; Resource security; Sustainability; Tradeoffs; Water planning",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The study focuses on the case of Algeria, a country with a rich and diversified tourist potential that should definitely be a destination on the international or regional scale, just like its neighbors in the Maghreb (Morocco and Tunisia). Recent figures on Algeria's world rankings in terms of competitiveness described a reality far from this hypothesis. The 2017 Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Algeria in the 118th out of 136 countries. Same wise the World Economic Forum (WEF) in its 2018 edition, put Algeria in the least attractive countries ranked 92nd out of 140. As generally known the territorial attractiveness is at the core concept of the competitiveness of the touristic destinations. However, this does not apply in the case of Algeria, as developed further in this article the country is attractive but not competitive.An American researcher Allain Lew (Lew, 1987) established a framework for the tourism attraction. Lew proposed a definition to attractiveness as: “The basic element on which tourism is developed"" (Lew, 1987, p. 554) if we consider the definition of Lew, the Algerian territory is extremely attractive, therefore contradictory to the above mentioned rankings. This definition brings out a substantial problem, related to the measurement of attractiveness. On what basis can we say that one territory is attractive or that it is more attractive than another? What indicators are used to classify the territories according to their degree of attractiveness? To answer this problem, we have proceeded to a comparative approach of different rankings and their respective effectiveness. We also proceeded to a quantitative approach which consists in calculating two indicators of tourist attractiveness across the Algerian territory for the period 2008-2017.

Sources with these types of elements are of great interest for the tourism and geothermal industry because of their highlighted properties which include therapeutic treatments, relaxation baths, agricultural applications, and preservation of flora and fauna among others. For these reasons, research oriented to carry out the characterization of these factors is of great importance to determine the availability of places with such characteristics. This work shows the characterization of 17 hot spring sources located in the Coconuco and San Juan sectors (Cauca, Colombia, South America). Water samples were taken in May 2017, and laboratory analyses were carried out by the Water Laboratory at Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Manizales, based on the Standard Methods (APHA-AWWA-WEF). Rock samples were taken in November 2017, and laboratory analyses were carried out by the GMAS+ Laboratory (Bogotá, Colombia). The Piper, Stiff, and ternary (Giggenbach) diagrams were used for the classification of major ions. Mineralogy composition was determined through XRD and XRF. Results indicate that most sources are of the sulphated type according to the anions and of the calcium type according to the cations. In concordance with Giggenbach diagrams, most of the sources are immature waters and, despite their interaction with rocks, they have not achieved the equilibrium. Likewise, these sources are of heated vapor type and, considering that they consist of sulphated acid sources, it is not possible to evaluate the reservoir temperatures from Na/K cations. The low Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio in the sources indicates the lack of direct migration of fluids and the high content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ regarding Na+ and K+, which suggests that fluids possibly are mixed with cold waters rich in Ca2+ and Mg2+. From the mineralogic characterization, it was observed that volcanic rocks are composed of cristobalite and albite with TiO2, Fe2O3, and CaO traces and mineral sulfur. Metals like Cr, considered in this case as contaminants, are found in low concentrations in rocks and are not detected in these waters. © 2019 Darwin Augusto Torres-Ceron et al.",,"anion; calcium; chemical property; hydrothermal system; mineralogy; physical property; sulfate; thermal spring; volcanic rock; Cauca; Colombia",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

In this paper, we focus on two common approaches to nexus research, quantitative modeling and futures thinking, and the ways that each set of methodological tools address uncertainty. We first review the underlying assumptions of each approach with a focus on sources of and ability to measure uncertainty, and potential complementarities. Quantitative modeling takes a probabilistic approach to predicting the likelihood of a specific outcome or future state based on estimates of current system dynamics. In contrast, futures thinking approaches, such as scenario processes, explore novel changes that cannot be fully predicted or even anticipated based on current understandings of the nexus. We then examine a set of applied nexus projects that bridge science and policy-making contexts to better understand practitioner experiences with different methodological tools and how they are utilized to navigate uncertainty. We explore one nexus case study, LIVES Cambodia, in-depth, to better understand the opportunities and challenges associated with participatory modeling and stakeholder engagement with uncertainty in a policy-making context. Across the cases, practitioners identify the complementarity between modeling and futures thinking approaches, and those projects that integrated both into the planning process experienced benefits from having multiple angles on uncertainty within the nexus. In particular, stakeholder engagement provided critical opportunities to address some types of uncertainties (e.g., data gaps) through the use of local knowledge. Explicit discussions of model uncertainty and use of scenario processes also enabled stakeholders to deepen their understandings of uncertainties and envision policy pathways that would be robust to uncertainty. In many senses, models became boundary objects that encouraged critical thinking and questioning of assumptions across diverse stakeholders. And, for some nexus projects, confronting uncertainty in explicit and transparent ways build capacity for policy flexibility and adaptiveness. We conclude with a discussion of when and how these benefits can be fully realized through the strategic use of appropriate approaches to characterizing and navigating nexus uncertainty. © 2019 Yung, Louder, Gallagher, Jones and Wyborn.","Futures thinking; Governance; Modeling; Nexus; Scenario planning; Stakeholder engagement; Water-energy-food",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This review assessed the current status of irrigated agriculture in southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective. Gaps and opportunities for improving irrigated agriculture within the context of the WEF nexus were also assessed in terms of the feasible limits to which they can be exploited. Southern Africa faces water scarcity, and climate projections show that member states will face increased physical and/or economic water scarcity by as early as 2025, which will have negative impacts on water, energy and food production. Recurrent droughts experienced across the region reaffirm the sensitive issues of food and energy insecurity as well as water scarcity. Projections of an increasing population within the region indicate increased water, energy and food demand. With agriculture already accounting for about 70% of water withdrawals, increasing the area under irrigation will place additional demand on already strained energy grids and scarce water resources. This poses the question-is increasing irrigated agriculture a solution to improving water access, food security and energy supply? While there are prospects for increasing the area under irrigation and subsequent improvement in agricultural productivity, adopting a WEF nexus approach in doing so would mitigate trade-offs and unintended consequences. Consideration of the WEF nexus in integrated resources planning and management eliminates the possibilities of transferring problems from one sector to other, as it manages synergies and trade-offs. While it is acknowledged that improving water productivity in irrigated agriculture could reduce water and energy use while increasing yield output, there is a need to decide how such savings would then be reallocated. Any intervention to increase the irrigated area should be done in the context of a WEF nexus analytical framework to guide policy and decision-making. Technical planning should evolve around the WEF nexus approach in setting targets, as WEF nexus indicators would reveal the performance and impact of proposed interventions on any of the three WEF nexus components. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture; Irrigation; Southern Africa; Water accounting; Water productivity; WEF nexus","Agriculture; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Irrigation; Water management; Agricultural productivity; Integrated resources planning; Irrigated agriculture; Southern Africa; Unintended consequences; Water accountings; Water productivity; WEF nexus; Productivity; agricultural production; analytical framework; climate prediction; energy use; food production; food security; irrigation system; trade-off; water planning; water stress; water use efficiency; Southern Africa",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

A case in point are hydropower investments on shared rivers which might impact the provision of energy, water and food security across borders. In international basins, governing the WEF nexus impacts of hydropower relies on voluntary negotiations between the respective countries involved. It has been argued that such negotiations may be facilitated by regional organizations, such as international river basin organizations (IRBOs), but this claim has hardly been investigated systematically. Drawing on regime theory in international relations and the literature on benefit sharing, this paper asks what role regional organizations may play in governing hydropower-related WEF nexus impacts. It compares three cases of hydropower planning on shared rivers. The Rusumo Falls and the Ruzizi III hydropower projects (HPPs) are joint investments in Africa's Great Lakes region facilitated by an IRBO and a regional energy organization, respectively. On the Mekong, Laos is constructing the Xayaburi dam despite reservations by the Mekong River Commission and downstream riparians. The paper finds IRBOs and regional energy organizations may play a role in facilitating cross-border nexus governance by supporting benefit-sharing arrangements and by fostering the application of environmental and social safeguards and international law principles. However, it also shows that the influence of regional organizations varies, and how successfully they support nexus governance also depends on whether the HPP is planned unilaterally or jointly; the availability and consensus on data on nexus impacts; and the presence or absence of donors and private sector capital and investors. © 2018 Dombrowsky and Hensengerth.","Governance; Hydropower; River basin organization; Rusumo Falls; Ruzizi III; Transboundary river; Water-energy-food nexus; Xayaburi",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The development degree was evaluated by measuring the gap between the existing state and the ideal state based on the distance synergy method. Considering the synergy relationship between each subsystem, the grey correlation analysis method was used to determine the pull factors between each subsystem, and then the synergy degree was calculated.

This study was therefore undertaken to investigate and acquire endogenous knowledge on the diversity of the main wild edible and medicinal fungi in Cameroon’s humid forests. The fungi species were collected during mycological excursions and described through structured and semi-structured surveys conducted in some twenty sites in five regions of southern Cameroon. Ninety-four WEF taxa were identified, belonging to 32 families and 41 genera. About 61.7% were saprotrophic taxa, 21.3% ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and 17% of the Termitomyces genus, the latter being the commonly collected and consumed. The high diversity of the fungi was reflected in their varied range of habitats and ecological niches. The most prized WEF are the saprotropic Armillaria camerounensis and Volvariella volvacea species, all Termitomyces species and chanterelles. Most of these fungi are collected as food. The twenty-odd ectomycorrhizal species develop in symbiosis with the roots of forest tree species of 13 genera in the Cesalpiniaceae and Phyllantaceae families.

Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development. Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically, this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy. Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food, and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20% in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean, sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches. In this regard, a well-coordinated and integrated WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems, harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13). © 2018 by the authors.

Despite growing attention paid to the WEF nexus, the role that renewable energies can play in addressing trade-offs and realising synergies has received limited attention. Until now, the focus of WEF nexus discussions and applications has mainly been on national or global levels, macro-level drivers, material flows and large infrastructure developments. This overlooks the fact that major nexus challenges are faced at local level. Aiming to address these knowledge gaps, the authors conduct a systematic analysis of the linkages between small-scale energy projects in developing countries and the food and water aspects of development. The analysis is based on empirical data from continuous process and impact evaluations complemented by secondary data and relevant literature. The study provides initial insights into how to identify interconnections and the potential benefits of integrating the nexus pillars into local level projects in the global south. The study identifies the complex links which exist between sustainable energy projects and the food and water sectors and highlights that these needs are currently not systematically integrated into project design or project evaluation. A more systematic approach, integrating the water and food pillars into energy planning at local level in the global south, is recommended to avoid trade-offs and enhance the development outcomes and impacts of energy projects. © 2018 The Authors","Developing countries; Local level; Sustainable development; Sustainable energy; System thinking; Water-energy-food nexus; WEF nexus","alternative energy; conceptual framework; developing world; energy planning; infrastructural development; project design; sustainable development; Article; biomass; conceptual framework; continuous process; developing country; environmental management; evidence based practice; green chemistry; renewable energy; solar radiation; sustainable development; wind; catering service; environmental protection; food; water supply; water; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food; Food Supply; Water; Water Supply",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

Resource evaluation is one of the stages in resource management to ensure that the existence of those sectors is provided sustainably. The assessment of the agglomeration level and growth of each sector in economic development can give better insights for local stakeholders either government bodies or private firms to improve sustainable management of these sectors. The objectives of this paper are to portray the agglomeration level and recent growth of WEF related sectors in local regions in Indonesia, and to determine possible sustainable development strategies. The location quotient (LQ) and competitive position (CP) analysis methods are employed in this regard. By analysing Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) between 2000 and 2015, basic and non-basic sectors have been determined. Results show that the general characteristics of WEF related sectors in this region can be distinguished clearly based on its main economic development focus. Results show recent growth in WEF sectors locally, from which possible strategies for future sustainable development are formulated that could be considered in the evaluation and planning process. This approach can be expected to assist local government and stakeholders in undertaking preliminary evaluation, in particular the availability of WEF resources, ensuring that development meets local and national sustainable development targets. © 2018","Basic sector; Competitive position; Gross regional domestic product (GRDP); Location quotient; Non-basic sector; Water–energy–food (WEF)",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

An ontology engineering method, which is a qualitative method, was applied for the replicability of the WEF nexus domain ontology and the map, because ontology engineering is a method of semantic web development for enhancing the compatibility of qualitative descriptions logically or objectively. The WEF nexus system map has three underlying concepts: (1) systems thinking, (2) holistic thinking, and (3) an integrated approach at an operational level, according to the hypothesis that the chains of changes in linkages between water, energy, and food resources holistically and systemically affect the WEF nexus system, including natural and social systems, both temporally and spatially. This study is significant because it allows us to (1) develop the WEF nexus domain ontology database, including defining the concepts and sub-concepts of trade-offs relating to WEF for the replicability of this study; (2) integrate the qualitative ontology method and quantitative network analysis method to identify key concepts serving as linkage hubs in the WEF nexus domain ontology; and (3) visualize human-nature interactions such as linkages between water, energy, and food resources and their stakeholders in social and natural systems.

At present, shortage of water resource has been emerging one of the urgent problems that many cities in China are facing due to rapid urbanization. In this work, water ecological footprint method has been applied to demonstrate how the sustainable utilization of water resources can be realized. According to the basic principle and calculation model of water ecological footprint, the water ecological footprint (WEF) and water ecological carrying capacity (WEC) in a period of 2004–2015 in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing were analyzed. Then, the water ecological footprints per capita were predicted with the quadratic exponential smoothing in 2020 and 2025, respectively. The results show that the total WEF in these cities except for Shanghai increased from 2004 to 2015. The productive WEF was the primary consumption account in the total WEF accounts of the four cities. In 2015, the productive WEFs of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing accounted for 54.46%, 82.61%, 75.04%, and 80.03% of total WEF amounts, respectively. At the same time, the proportion of the WEF of tertiary industry in Beijing was as high as 50.14% in the productive WEF accounts. The biggest proportion of the WEF of secondary industry was 59.14% and 53.14% in Shanghai and Chongqing, respectively. In Tianjin, the WEF of primary industry was the biggest proportion, accounting for 65.03%. In terms of the WEF per capita, we also found that the water ecological surplus per capita for Tianjin occurred only in 2012 indicating serious water ecological deficit in the other years. While the water ecological deficit per capita occurred in Shanghai before 2014 and exited in Beijing in the whole study period, which suggested that water resource utilization was not sustainable. However, the WEC per capita in Chongqing was bigger than the WEF per capita during 2004–2015, contributing to the water ecological surplus per capita in Chongqing. That is to say, the sustainable utilization of water resources in Chongqing was rational. It is evidenced that such changes of the total WEF are closely related to the productive WEF. We thus suggest that the productive structure associated with the distribution of water resources in different cities should be manipulated towards improving the WEC, reducing the WEF and fix regional water imbalance for further promoting the sustainable development of the overall socio-economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Exponential smoothing model; Water ecological carrying capacity; Water ecological footprint; Water ecological footprint accounts","Ecology; Distribution of water; Ecological footprint; Exponential smoothing; Exponential smoothing analysis; Exponential smoothing model; Sustainable utilization; Water ecological carrying capacities; Water resource utilization; Water resources",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Yet, stakeholders interact with nexus issues in a variety of ways, consequently there is much that collaboration might offer to develop nexus research and enhance its application. This paper outlines four aspects of nexus research and considers the value and potential challenges for transdisciplinary research in each.

The paper then proceeds to describe a novel mixed-method study that deeply integrates stakeholder knowledge with insights from multiple disciplines.

Beginning by clarifying the concept of global business associations, the author puts their role into a historical and contemporary context in which their economic, social and political functions are sketched. Their historical origin is outlined, including the proliferation of global associations in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. He then moves on to explore and analyse the different types of actors, explaining key categories and their place in the organization of global business with chapters on peak associations (e.g. ICC and WEF), industry associations, alliances, as well as clubs and think tanks, and facilitators.

First, as this mission is based on technical changes and financing procured by non-state actors, WEF will have to become an actor for reasons of empowerment equitability.

Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer worldwide and sugarcane is cultivated in many regions, including the Brazilian Cerrado (a Savannah-type biome). This paper analyses the impacts of first-generation sugarcane expansion in the Paranaíba basin (Goiás State), focusing on how future demand for ethanol could affect local resources availability. The study area is a sugarcane expansion frontier in Brazil, thus, the Cerrado biome should be focus of research considering competition for land and water uses. An economic-ecologic Input-Output (IO) framework was applied to develop a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analysis. The Goiás’ IO table was expanded to assess water, energy and land uses, GHG emissions and employment levels through six different ethanol supply scenarios. Results show that if sugarcane expansion projected to 2030 considers the Goiás’ extended IO structure for the year 2008, it should cause little impact on land and water availability in the state, due to both the ample availability of suitable pasturelands for sugarcane expansion as well as water in most of the Paranaíba basin.

It is represented by hyper automation and hyper connectivity based on artificial intelligence (AI), big data, robotics, and Internet of things (IoT). AI, big data, and robotics can contribute to developing hyper automation that can increase productivity and intensify industrial production. Particularly, robots using AI can make decision by themselves as human being on complicated processes. Along with the hyper automation, the hyper connectivity increases not only at national, but also global level by using information and communication technologies (ICT). IoT is the core technology to create the hyper connectivity in Cyber Physical System (CPS) that connects technology, nature, and human being. Accordingly, a perfect convergence between ICT and manufacturing can be completed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era and an extremely efficient flexible production system by spreading IoT in CPS will be established. Under such a condition, innovative clusters must play their traditional roles in cradles of technology innovation and commercialization. It must be difficult challenges for innovative clusters to meet their targets and to be adjusted by the changing new environment at the same time. This paper argues how the Fourth Industrial Revolution can change the global production chain and how core technologies function in industries. Furthermore, it focuses on how innovative clusters have to evolve to respond the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Last, but not least it also analyzes whether or not innovative clusters can play their roles as technology innovation hubs in the real world and CPS in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","CPS; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Hyper automation; Hyper connectivity; Innovative cluster policies","Automation; Economics; Embedded systems; Engineering research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Robotics; Cluster policy; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Flexible production systems; Hyper connectivity; Industrial production; Industrial revolutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet of Things (IOT); Big data",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The Blue Nile Basin, a transboundary river basin between Ethiopia and Sudan, is used to illustrate the impacts of cooperation between riparian countries on the Water-Energy-Food nexus (WEF nexus). These impacts are quantified and evaluated using a daily model that simulates hydrological processes, irrigation water requirements, and water allocation to hydro-energy generation and irrigation water supply. Satellite-based rainfall data are evaluated and applied as a boundary condition to model the hydrological processes. The model is used to determine changes in the long-term economic gain (i.e. after infrastructure development plans are implemented and in steady operation) for each of Sudan and Ethiopia independently, and for the Blue Nile Basin from WEF in 120 scenarios. Those scenarios result from combinations of three cooperation states: unilateral action, coordination, and collaboration; and infrastructure development settings including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and planned irrigation schemes in Sudan. The results show that the economic gain of the Blue Nile Basin from WEF increases with raising the cooperation level between Ethiopia and Sudan to collaboration.

Previous studies investigating different aspects of this system have a number of shortcomings, meaning it is difficult to identify system-wide tradeoffs, and makes comparison difficult. A global analysis of the WEF system linked to gross domestic product (GDP) growth is presented, integrating the four sectors into a coherent analysis and modelling framework. GDP was included as previous related work demonstrates a link between GDP and each WEF sector. A system dynamics modelling approach quantifies previously qualitative descriptions of the global WEF-GDP system, while a Monte-Carlo sampling approach is adopted to characterise national-level variability in resource use. Correlative and causal analysis show links of varying strength between sectors. For example, the GDP-electricity consumption sectors are strongly correlated while food production and electricity consumption are weakly correlated. Causal analysis reveals that ‘correlation does not imply causation’. There are noticeable asymmetries in causality between certain sectors. Historical WEF-GDP values are well recreated. Future scenarios were assessed using seven GDP growth estimates to 2100. Water withdrawals in 2100 and food production in 2050 are close to other estimations. Results suggest that humanity risks exceeding the 'safe operating space’ for water withdrawal. Reducing water withdrawal while maintaining or increasing food production is critical, and should be decoupled from economic growth. This work provides a quantitative modelling framework to previously qualitative descriptions of the WEF-GDP system, offering a platform on which to build. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Causality; Correlation; GDP; Nexus; System dynamics; Water-energy-food","Correlation methods; Electric power utilization; Monte Carlo methods; System theory; Causality; Electricity-consumption; Gross domestic product growths; Monte Carlo sampling; Nexus; System Dynamics; System dynamics modelling; Water energy; Economics; correlation; electricity supply; energy use; exploitation; food supply; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; qualitative analysis; trade-off; water use; Article; comparative study; economic development; ecosystem; electricity; energy consumption; food industry; global water energy food system; gross national product; population model; qualitative analysis; risk factor; water supply",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

About 60% of the population in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) live in rural areas relying mainly on rainfed agriculture, lacking access to clean water and energy, yet the region is endowed with vast natural resources. The waterenergy- food (WEF) nexus is a conceptual framework that presents opportunities for greater resource coordination, management, and policy convergence across sectors. This is particularly relevant in the SADC region as resources are transboundary and supports efforts linked to regional integration and inclusive socio-economic development and security. We conducted an appraisal of WEF-related policies and institutions in SADC and identified linkages among them. The present 'silo' approach in resource management and allocation, often conducted at the national level, contributes to the region's failure to meet its development targets, exacerbating its vulnerabilities. The lack of coordination of WEF nexus synergies and trade-offs in planning often threatens the sustainability of development initiatives. We highlighted the importance of the WEF nexus to sustainably address the sectoral coordination of resources through harmonised institutions and policies, as well as setting targets and indicators to direct and monitor nexus developments.

This approach is unique from other natural resource research agendas where the primary focus is on system efficiencies or examinations of a single resource. The nexus by emphasizing trade-offs places a premium on coordination. From a governance perspective coordination is not limited to decisions involving finances and allocation of trained human resources among different agencies orga nized both vertically and horizontally within a multi-level governance framework. Coordination could also be extended to include uses of data between public agencies, private sector and individuals. Due to nexus interconnectivity, we suggest here that social network analysis (SNA) is an appropriate tool that can divulge and highlight the relational complexities that exist within the nexus and among stakeholders that work with the singular elements of the nexus. We suggest that in the cases of organi sations with a high institutional capacity by means of expertise, resources, and other assets, the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) network will be highly connected between resource areas in the overall network.

The nexus approach aims to identify tradeoffs and synergies of water, energy, and food systems, internalize social and environmental impacts, and guide development of cross-sectoral policies. However, while the WEF nexus offers a promising conceptual approach, the use of WEF nexus methods to systematically evaluate water, energy, and food interlinkages or support development of socially and politically-relevant resource policies has been limited. This paper reviews WEF nexus methods to provide a knowledge base of existing approaches and promote further development of analytical methods that align with nexus thinking. The systematic review of 245 journal articles and book chapters reveals that (a) use of specific and reproducible methods for nexus assessment is uncommon (less than one-third); (b) nexus methods frequently fall short of capturing interactions among water, energy, and food - the very linkages they conceptually purport to address; (c) assessments strongly favor quantitative approaches (nearly three-quarters); (d) use of social science methods is limited (approximately one-quarter); and (e) many nexus methods are confined to disciplinary silos - only about one-quarter combine methods from diverse disciplines and less than one-fifth utilize both quantitative and qualitative approaches. To help overcome these limitations, we derive four key features of nexus analytical tools and methods - innovation, context, collaboration, and implementation - from the literature that reflect WEF nexus thinking. By evaluating existing nexus analytical approaches based on these features, we highlight 18 studies that demonstrate promising advances to guide future research.

Studies have shown that some of the dams built in the tributaries and the main stem of the upper Mekong have already caused basin-wide impacts by altering the magnitude and seasonality of flows, blocking sediment transport, affecting fisheries and livelihoods of downstream inhabitants, and changing the flood pulse to the Tonle Sap Lake. There are hundreds of additional dams planned for the near future that would result in further changes, potentially causing permanent damage to the highly productive agricultural systems and fisheries, as well as the riverine and floodplain ecosystems. Several studies have examined the potential impacts of existing and planned dams but the integrated effects of the dams when combined with the adverse hydrologic consequences of climate change remain largely unknown. Here, we provide a detailed review of the existing literature on the changes in climate, land use, and dam construction and the resulting impacts on hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems across the Mekong. The review provides a basis to better understand the effects of climate change and accelerating human water management activities on the coupled hydrological-agricultural-ecological systems, and identifies existing challenges to study the region'sWater, Energy, and Food (WEF) nexus with emphasis on the influence of future dams and projected climate change. In the last section, we synthesize the results and highlight the urgent need to develop integrated models to holistically study the coupled natural-human systems across the basin that account for the impacts of climate change and water infrastructure development. This review provides a framework for future research in the Mekong, including studies that integrate hydrological, agricultural, and ecological modeling systems. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Dams; Hydrology; Hydropower; Mekong river basin","Agriculture; Climate models; Dams; Ecology; Fisheries; Floods; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrology; Land use; Rivers; Sediment transport; Water management; Watersheds; Agricultural system; Ecological modeling; Ecological systems; Hydropower; Integrated effects; Management activities; Mekong river basins; Water infrastructure; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; dam construction; ecological modeling; floodplain; hydroelectric power; hydrological modeling; land use change; water management; Cambodia; Mekong River; Tonle Sap Lake",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We contend that existing technologies can be reframed and emerging technologies can be harnessed for integrated FEW management, changing the way that each resource system operates within the broader system. We discuss solutions to three main challenges to integrating FEW system management: resolving spatiotemporal disconnections over multiple scales; closing resource loops; and creating actionable information. Sustainable resource management is critical for humanity, as well as for functioning trade systems and ecological health.

The MES performs real-time frequency estimation using a recursive discrete Fourier transform based algorithm. Network time protocol (NTP) is used for time synchronization, increasing the system flexibility by eliminating global positioning system reliance. An NTP-based synchronized sampling control method is proposed and implemented in MES to compensate the sampling time error caused by local time drift and division residue.

This enables a free flow of information across the factory and facilitates future expansion of the automated system. Increasing levels of data can begin to restrict transmission speeds, which ultimately could affect productivity.

The multi-criterial approach and the assessment methodologies relating to the global competitiveness have been dynamically adjusted over the recent years to reflect the current globalization trends in the world economy. The main objective of this study is to analyse the objectivity and resulting values' deviations of the Global competitiveness Index (GCI) and World Competitiveness Index (WCI) composite indexes that are currently considered to be the world's most respected and to identify the impact of key factors that affect the countries' competitive positions with a focus on Slovakia. The research study is realized within the group of EU (24) countries for the period 2006 – 2016. The partial objective is to summarize the main starting points of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Institute for Management Development (IMD) composing these indices, to identify their common features and different approaches that create differences in the results achieved. Then we analyzed the differences between the resulting rankings and the resulting scores of the GCI and WCI rated countries. In the next part, we focused on analyzing the position of Slovakia using the correlation and multiple regression analysis and identifying the interrelationships between individual pillars and the GCI score in order to determine the impact of key factors that influence the competitive position and sustainable growth of Slovakia and improve or worsen its position. Our results highlighted the economic and statistical context of GCI Slovakia development and the impact of the following key pillars and key factors: pillar P1 (P1: Institutions – Public trust in politicians), pillar P3 (P3: Macroeconomic environment – Government debt) and pillar P11 (P11: Business sophistication – Nature of competitive advantage). All three pillars, identified as crucial to the development of the overall Slovakias' GCI scores, occupy unflattering positions in the comparison of pillar rankings. Therefore, we conclude that it is necessary to clarify the causes of their development and eliminate these identified factors as soon as possible.

The production and consumption of water, energy and food resources are inextricably linked across multiple spatial scales (from the global to the local), but a common feature is competition for land which through different land management practices mediates provisioning ecosystem services. The nexus perspective seeks to understand the interlinkages and use systems-based thinking to frame management options for the present and the future. It aims to highlight advantage and minimise damaging and unsustainable outcomes through informed decisions regarding trade-offs inclusive of economic, ecological and equity considerations. Operationalizing the WEF approach is difficult because of the lack of complete data, knowledge and observability - and the nature of the challenge also depends on the scale of the investigation. Transboundary river basins are particularly challenging because whilst the basin unit defines the hydrological system this is not necessarily coincident with flows of food and energy. There are multiple national jurisdictions and geopolitical relations to consider. Land use changes have a profound influence on hydrological, agricultural, energy provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Future policy decisions in the water, energy and food sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land and water resources, intensifying competition for these resources in the future. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse the land cover changes in the Zambezi river basin (1.4 million km2) from 1992 to 2015 using the European Space Agency annual global land cover dataset. Early results indicate transformative processes are underway with significant shifts from tree cover to cropland, with a 4.6 % loss in tree cover and a 16 % gain in cropland during the study period. The changes were found to be occurring mainly in the eastern (Malawi and Mozambique) and southern (Zimbabwe and southern Zambia) parts of the basin. The area under urban land uses was found to have more than doubled during the study period gearing urban centres increasingly as the foci for resource consumption. These preliminary findings are the first step in understanding the spatial and temporal interlinkages of water, energy and food by providing reliable and consistent evidence spanning the local, regional, national and whole transboundary basin scale. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Decision making; Earth (planet); Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Space applications; Watersheds; Earth observation data; European Space Agency; Land management practices; Production and consumption; Regulatory decisions; Resource consumption; Trans-boundary rivers; Transboundary basins; Water resources","","IAHS Scientific Assembly 2017 - Water Security and the Food-Water-Energy Nexus: Drivers, Responses and Feedbacks at Local to Global Scales","10 July 2017 through 14 July 2017",,136331,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The purpose of this paper is to provide information for improving national competitiveness in different countries around the world through identifying the most impactful indexes affecting its level. The analyzed sample consists of 102 countries out of 138, omitting countries at two transition stages. Moreover, a canonical correlation analysis has been employed to investigate the interaction between the two pillars. Our findings show that there is a significant and positive relationship between the set of ""Business Sophistication"" and ""Macroeconomic Environment"", consequently this link exists and varies depending on the stage of development that a country has achieved. © 2018, revistaESPACIOS.com.","Business Sophistication; Canonical correlation analysis; Economic growth; Global Competitiveness; Macroeconomic Environment; World competitive indexes",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The Asia-Pacific region in particular has the highest number of total occurrences, fatalities and effects of natural disaster events (flood and cyclone) and is no stranger to mega-disasters such as the likes of Super Typhoon Haiyan and Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004. According to the World Economic Forum ‘The world is insufficiently prepared for an increasingly complex risk environment’ (WEF, Global Risks 2015 10th edn: insight report, 2015). The threats to human security that we face today are multiple, complex and interrelated and often mutually reinforcing. As such, ‘Global risks cannot be seen in isolation’ (WEF, Global Risks 2015 10th edn: insight report, 2015). The hyper-connected world we live in is underpinned by hyper or hybrid-risks, whereby ‘…the fragility and vulnerabilities lie within the social/technological/economic/political/ecological interdependent systems’ (Masys AJ, Ray-Bennett N, Shiroshita H, Jackson P, Procedia Econ Financ 18:772–779, 2014). It is through these underlying networks that Helbing (Nature 497:51–59, 2013) argues that we have ‘… created pathways along which dangerous and damaging events can spread rapidly and globally’ and thereby has increased systemic risks. The Asia-Pacific region faces many human security challenges associated with meeting food, water, and energy requirements in scenarios that stress the human security ‘ecosystem’. A Chatham House report ‘Preparing for High Impact, Low Probability Events’, found that governments and businesses remain unprepared for such events (Lee B, Preston F, Green G, Preparing for high-impact, low – probability events: lessons from Eyjafjallajokull. A Chatham House Report, London, 2012). This chapter presents the Asia-Pacific Security landscape as a complex ‘ecosystem’ that requires concepts, tools and perspectives from complexity theory, systems thinking and network science to support regional and global security risk management. The key is to embrace a strategic visioning and actioning that examines the interdependencies and interconnectivity across various ‘actors’ in the security ecosystem and how black swan events can stress the system. This is examined through the lens of Human security that lies at the center of the water-food-energy nexus as well as the disaster risk reduction, sustainability and development nexus. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Asia-Pacific; Complexity; Human security; Network mindset; Systems thinking",,,,,,,"English",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

Hence many countries struggle to have these rating systems that suite the need of its stakeholders. The study compares the two widely accepted rating systems in Malaysia. These are Green Building Index (GBI) and Green Real Estate (GreenRE) are specifically design and developed for Malaysian tropical weather, environmental and development context, cultural and social needs. GBI rating system developed 15 assessment tools and GreenRE have 4 assessment tools therefore, only four assessment tools were compared. The total credits allocation are 100/154Cr, 100/183Cr and 100/184Cr and total parameters of 39Pr/24Pr, 51Pr/29Pr and 44Pr/30Pr for RNB, NRNB, NREB assessment tools for GBI/GreenRE respectively. Among the criteria, energy, water, indoor and outdoor environmental qualities were given high priority with high credit and parameters allocation. GreenRE give more priority in EEF and WEF category as compared to GBI with putting more priority over GreenRE in the remaining as it consider more categories of buildings, parameters in the remaining criteria and higher rating grade. It is easier to score credits and attain high ratings in the GreenRE assessment tools than GBI assessment tools even though in both the sustainability issues considered are similar. The results from GBI and GreenRE assessment exercise are solely dependent on the personality, quality and experience of the assessor. All the tools are pointing to a single similar objective that is the implementing the principle of sustainability in the Malaysian build environment and hence they are both suitable for assessing Malaysian buildings. The review will help in understanding the ratings systems and useful for countries developing rating systems for their built environment. © 2018 UTHM Publisher.","Assessment; Building; Credit; Environment; GBI; GreenRE; Parameters; Residential and sustainability",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

It has been claimed that a significant contributor to thisincrease has been the Operators tendency to prefer bespoke designs, customized totheir internal technical requirements as the basis for new developments. Subsea suppliers have argued that cost reduction and schedule advantage would result if Operators were to focus more on functional needs, using repeat designsbased onless prescriptive technical requirements when developing assets. In 2012 TOTAL initiated work to increase efficiencies and reduce cost in subsea developments. Following the oil price collaps in 2014 the need to accelerate this work and to find even larger efficiency gains became evident. In collaboration with the industry, options were discussed and actions agreed. For subsea the most visible global industrial technical alignment action was International Organization of Oil and Gas Producers - IOGP JIP 33 (initiated by World Economic Forum, WEF) - which resulted in the issue at the end of 2016 of the specification IOGP S561 -Supplementary Requirements to API Spec 17D for Subsea Trees. Thereare several alternative understandings of what constitutes Standardizationand hence alignment on actions to achive this may also vary signficiantly. One optionfor standardization is to accept what may be called ""Supplier Led solutions"", i.e. to accept existing supplier solutions/components withoutadditional company specific requirements, modifications or adaptations. There are several challenges with this approach as it potentially requires compromises on existing Company technical specifications, on the implementation of lessons learned, on established execution methods and processes etc. In 2015 TOTAL approached the subsea suppliers (system integrators) to identifyany already available supplier’s standards. Activities werethen initiated to compare these supplier standards with our internal standards/requirements. The objective was not necessarily to change the equipment proposed but rather to identify/understand any risks associated with the use of these supplier led solutions. This work took > 1 year and was near completion whenthe Absheron Early Production System (EPS) project opportunity was identified. Due to the work already completed, TOTAL was able to propose a solution to the Absheron EPS project meetingthe challenging rig schedule. Supplier led solutions, whilst a good option for certain developments, may not be the best solution for all developments. The experience with the Absheron EPS is a confirmation that TOTAL has the ability to adapt to the changing industry landscape and apply the highest value, fit-for-purpose solution to new subsea developments.

As a result, the water, energy, and food (WEF) nexus approach has emerged to understand interdependencies and commonly manage resources within a multi-scale and multi-level framework. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the high and growing consumption of traditional biomass for cooking purposes - notably fuelwood and charcoal-is both a key source of energy and contributor for food security as well as a pressure on natural resources. Improving the bioenergy value chains is essential for limiting environmental degradation and for securing the livelihoods of millions of people.

Based on the WEF nexus approach, we analyze the different steps within the charcoal value chain in Sub-Saharan Africa and highlight the respective interdependencies and the potential for improving overall socio-economic and environmental sustainability. We emphasize the water, energy and food related implications of vicious and virtuous production cycles, separated by value chain segments.

In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Results: While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Conclusions: Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended.

However, innovation is hard to define and, therefore, even harder to measure. To help policy makers and business leaders better understand how to foster innovation, we need robust ways to quantify innovation at local and global scales. In this work, we use a data-driven, machine-learning approach for measuring innovation. Analyzing a large number of country-level metrics, we aim to automatically discover actionable 'levers' of innovation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we determine groups of related world development indicators among a collection compiled by the World Bank. We then train a Group Lasso predictive model using data from the World Economic Forum (WEF) that captures the perceived level of innovation in 150 countries. Aside from providing high predictive accuracy, the Group Lasso also provides a model that is easily interpretable. The result is the Open Innovation Index (OII), an automatic global model for measuring innovation using machine learning algorithms and open data. We predict the OII scores for countries that only have World Development Indicators data and no existing WEF innovation scores. Furthermore, we also present case studies for which the innovation levers of a few representative countries are uncovered automatically by the proposed model. © 1957-2012 IBM.",,"Artificial intelligence; Economics; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Business leaders; Data-driven approach; Economic competitiveness; Level of innovation; Machine learning approaches; Predictive accuracy; Predictive modeling; Unsupervised learning method; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Singapore and Hong Kong have a similar history: both developed from British colonies and experienced an upgrade of industrial structure from labor intensive industries such as textile and clothing to high tech industries such as electronics and to banking and financial services (Young in NBER Macroeconomics Annual 7:13-51, 1992). The two city states have comparable economic performance and competitiveness and are often placed close to each other in various rankings such as Global Competitiveness Report (WEF 2016), World Competitiveness Yearbook (IMD 2016), Global Innovation Index (GII 2016). The GDP per capita in these two economies was almost identical until the 2000s. Singapore's economic growth slowed down in the late 1990s but quickly recovered and surpassed Hong Kong in 2004 and even overtook the US in 2011. With its recent success in finance and other sectors, Singapore is presently ahead of Hong Kong on many indicators. Although there are many similarities, the differences in the development trajectory of these two cities are clear, the most important distinction is the role of the government. Singapore is noted as government-made city-state for the high level of government intervention in various aspects of the society (Mok in Res Policy, 34, 537-554, 2005). By contrast, Hong Kong adopts a ""positive non-intervention"" policy that favors the free economy and minimizes the power of government in influencing the market. The difference is reflected in the innovation policy in these two economies. The Singapore government has actively implemented a series of strategies and allocated substantial funds to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. While a similar set of policies and programs are in place to drive research and innovation in Hong Kong, the scale is much smaller. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Hong Kong; Innovation activities; Innovation strategy; Patents; Singapore",,,,,,,"English",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

In view of the sustainable water management, several approaches have been proposed: Integrated Water Resources Management, Adaptive Management and, more recently, Water–Energy–Food (WEF) Nexus. Considering these approaches, over the last few decades, extensive efforts have been made to develop assessment methods and tools framed within the paradigm of sustainable development. As part of a holistic assessment of water resources, the recent approach based upon the WEF Nexus narrows down the consideration of intersectoral linkages to three dimensions that are of prominent interest, in particular in developing countries. This study presents a comprehensive indicator-based approach for the assessment of water, energy and food securities, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The main ambition of the proposed approach is to provide a tool to monitor progresses, compare different geographical areas, highlight synergies and conflicts amongst and within the three dimensions of the WEF Nexus, and provide support for improved—more effective—management strategies to meet the goals. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna (GBM) River Basin in Asia and to the Po River Basin in Europe. The comparative analysis suggests that WEF security is currently rather low in the GBM basin compared to the other case study and other parts of the world and allows the identification of which dimensions (indicators) require special attention on the part of local and global policy makers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Assessment; Indicators; Security index; Sustainable development goals; Water, Energy and Food Nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Here, the polarization-tuned electromagnetic (EM) field that facilitates the LSP coupling is fully discussed. Numerical analyses on waveguide-based evanescent fields (WEFs) coupled with the LSPs of dispersed silver nanospheres and silver nano-hemispheres are presented and the applicability of the WEF-LSPs to plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy is discussed. Compared with LSPs under direct light excitation that only provide 3-4 times enhancement of the incidence field, the WEF-LSPs can amplify the electric field intensity about 30-90 times (equaling the enhancement factor of 106-108 in SERS intensity), which is comparable to the EM amplification of the SERS “hot spot” effect. Importantly, the strongest region of EM enhancement around silver nanospheres can be modulated from the gap region to the side surface simply by switching the incident polarization from TM to TE, which widely extends its sensing applications in surface analysis of monolayer of molecule and macromolecule detections.

The effect of EF and its components on viruses has not been reported. In the present study, the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of EF (WEF) and its components were evaluated in vitro. We found that pretreatment with WEF markedly reduced viral replication, as evaluated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged virus (influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus) in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. We demonstrated that WEF induces the production of type I IFN including pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we identified the active anti-viral components of WEF as quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin. Thus, WEF and its active components are immunomodulators of the innate immune response in murine macrophages, a finding that is potentially useful to developing prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against a range of viruses. © 2017 Choi, Lee, Hwang, Lee, Cho and Ma.","Antiviral effect; Eupatorium fortunei; Herbal medicine; Quercetin; RNA viruses","angelicin; antivirus agent; caffeic acid; chlorogenic acid; coumarin; cynarine; cytokine; Eupatorium fortunei extract; ferulic acid; interferon; neochlorogenic acid; para coumaric acid; plant extract; psoralen; quercetin; quercitrin; rutoside; scopoletin; sweroside; syringin; unclassified drug; animal cell; antiviral activity; aqueous solution; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; drug mechanism; Eupatorium; Eupatorium fortunei; immunomodulation; in vitro study; Influenza A virus; innate immunity; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; macrophage; Newcastle disease virus; nonhuman; RNA virus; Vesiculovirus; virus cell interaction; virus replication",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Interestingly, while developed countries are lower in entrepreneurship characteristics than developing countries, the former have higher levels of global competitiveness than the latter (based on Global Entrepreneurship Monitor or GEM). Given this background, this study investigates the relationship between entrepreneurial spirit and global competitiveness at the national level. Entrepreneurial spirit is measured by entrepreneurial attitudes (comprising social value, personal attribute, and goal orientation) and entrepreneurial activities (total early entrepreneurial activities and established business ownerships), taken from the GEM’s 2015 data on national entrepreneurship. Global competitiveness is measured using the Global Competitiveness Index, taken from the World Economic Forum (WEF) for 2015. The study finds that all the entrepreneurial spirit factors have a negative relationship with global competitiveness, except for goal orientation (consisting of three indicators: growth, innovation, and internationalization, all of which have a positive and significant relationship with global competitiveness).

Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation. © 2017 International Energy Initiative",,"Decision making; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; International cooperation; Outages; Planning; Societies and institutions; Energy sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Indicators and indices; International atomic energy agency; National measurements; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Sustainable energy development; Sustainable energy systems; Sustainable development; decision making; energy policy; policy implementation; sustainability; sustainable development; Iceland",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

In the CCB, the conflicts in the WEF Nexus are apparent because of intensive agricultural practices that have contributed to chronic NO3− loading to groundwater. We evaluate the scale-dependent relations among source, transport, and attenuation (STA) factors that control NPS NO3− contamination in recently recharged CCB groundwater. Logistic regression models are presented for sub-regional and regional model domains. New hydrological insights for the region Dissolved oxygen (DO) (attenuation) in groundwater is often the most significant STA factor in all model domains, indicating that DO is an important, scale-invariant factor controlling NPS NO3− contamination. Farm fertilizer (source) is also a significant scale-invariant factor, while many of the transport factors are scale-dependent factors.

Effective planning and management of limited WEF resources to meet current and future socioeconomic demands for sustainable development is challenging. WEF production/delivery may also produce environmental impacts; as a result, green-house-gas emission control will impact WEF nexus management as well. Nexus management for WEF security necessitates integrated tools for predictive analysis that are capable of identifying the tradeoffs among various sectors, generating cost-effective planning and management strategies and policies. To address these needs, we have developed an integrated model analysis framework and tool called WEFO. WEFO provides a multi-period socioeconomic model for predicting how to satisfy WEF demands based on model inputs representing productions costs, socioeconomic demands, and environmental controls. WEFO is applied to quantitatively analyze the interrelationships and trade-offs among system components including energy supply, electricity generation, water supply-demand, food production as well as mitigation of environmental impacts. WEFO is demonstrated to solve a hypothetical nexus management problem consistent with real-world management scenarios.

We derive the average weight enumerator function (WEF) and compute the union bound on the performance for the uncoupled BCC ensemble. Our results suggest that the union bound is affected by poor distance properties of a small fraction of codes. By computing the union bound for the expurgated ensemble, we show that the floor improves substantially and very low error rates can be achieved for moderate permutation sizes. Based on the WEF, we also obtain a bound on the minimum distance which indicates that it grows linearly with the permutation size. Finally, we show that the estimated error floor for the uncoupled BCC ensemble is also valid for the coupled ensemble by proving that the minimum distance of the coupled ensemble is lower bounded by the minimum distance of the uncoupled ensemble. © 2016 IEICE.",,"Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Convolution; Floors; Information theory; Belief propagation; Error rate; Estimated error; Finite block length; Finite length; Minimum distance; Union bounds; Weight enumerator; Convolutional codes","Research Society of Information Theory and its Applications, Engineering Sciences Society, IEICE","3rd International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications, ISITA 2016","30 October 2016 through 2 November 2016",,126357,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Integration it was argued would help address the twin challenge. Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) was supposed to be that magic bullet and was embraced by scientists because of the clinical efficiency with which it argued for integrated analysis of sectors and resources and of systems and scale conditions. This paper argues that effective implementation of the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus can be supported by robust science. The corollary that robust science automatically leads to effective implementation is not always known to be true. The nexus approach sheds light on the challenges of implementation by introducing concepts of trade-offs and thresholds and consequently emphasizes the importance of transdisciplinary approaches to sustainable development. This paper reviews the results of recent research to offer tentative answers to the following questions: (a) Why is the governance dimension important to undertake an integrated analysis of water-energy-food challenges? (b) What does the nexus approach connote in normative and institutional terms? (c) What does implementation mean in nexus terms?

In the off-grid areas of developing countries, decentralized energy solutions have received increasing attention due to their contributions to reducing poverty. However, most of the rural population in many developing countries still has little or no access to modern energy technologies. This paper assesses the factors that determine the successes and failures of decentralized energy solutions based on local harmonized case studies from heterogeneous contexts from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The case studies were analyzed through the coupled lenses of energy transition and theWater-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus. The findings indicate that access to modern decentralized energy solutions has not resulted in complete energy transitions due to various tradeoffs with the other domains of the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, the case studies point at the potential for improvements in food security, incomes, health, the empowerment of women, and resource conservation when synergies between decentralized energy solutions and other components of the WEF Nexus are present. © 2017 by the authors.","Decentralized energy; Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Here, a wealth of publications is reviewed in an endeavour to: (1) reveal the lines of justification for the need of the WEF nexus debate and (2) identify the range of tools for analysing the interdependent resource issues of the nexus using an integrated framework of science and policy. There are three drivers behind the emergence of the nexus thinking. These are a) increasing resource interlinks due to growing scarcities, b) recent resource supply crises, and c) failures of sector-driven management strategies. Evaluation of the WEF nexus integrative debate can be carried out using four key criteria, namely ability to change current policy debates, issue and thinking novelty, practicability and measurability, and clearness and implementation roadmap. It is clear that, although the nexus has been quite successful in changing policy debates, issue prioritization is missing and seems to be left to specific case studies and policymakers' choices. There is a high need for ‘incorporation’ and ‘cross-linking’ of issues between the three resources. In this regard, nexus governance is the missing link in the nexus debate. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental policy; Integrated management; Integrative approaches; Resource security; Sustainability paradigm; WEF nexus","Environmental management; Sustainable development; Environmental policy; Integrated management; Integrative approaches; Resource security; WEF nexus; Environmental protection; energy; environmental management; environmental policy; food; integrated approach; literature review; sustainability; water; cross linking; decision making; environmental management; environmental planning; government; life cycle assessment; priority journal; Review; water energy and food nexus; catering service; energy resource; environmental protection; food; water supply; water; Conservation of Natural Resources; Energy-Generating Resources; Food; Food Supply; Water; Water Supply",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus

Land and the natural resources integrated in it are regarded as the physical reference units of the WEFS in a nexus perspective. From the one side, land is the complex system of resources, material and natural ones in particular, which sustain WEFS security and quality in terms of production and consumption models. From the other side, the production of WEFS demands for production surfaces which represent the field where different uses and use models meet and produce cross impacts and trade-offs. The land quality, availability and, mainly, model of use become crucial factors to guarantee a stable and adequate offer of WEFS. This in the light of a growing demand for the protection of the natural environments and the ecosystems and for enhancing the quality of social services, in a perspective of resilience and sustainability. Finally, a brief presentation of a case study will be proposed, regarding the story of the Lago d’Idro (Idro Lake).

The notion of sustainable development refers to balancing economic, social and environmental objectives for the betterment of society, now and in the future (see Dhakal 2012; UN 2015). The state of economic and human capital development in the South Asian region – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – is quite varied, and data indicate that these countries are collectively transitioning towards the middle-income bracket. For example, the Gross National Income (GNI) varies from US $630 in Afghanistan to US $6,670 in Maldives and only one country in the region – Sri Lanka with a GNI of US $3,800 – is ranked 50th amongst 130 countries in the Human Capital Index (HCI) (WEF 2016; World Bank 2016a). The HCI assesses the result of past and current investments in education and offers insight into a country’s talent base in the future (WEF 2016 p. 1). Although South Asian countries have made substantial investments in education and employment generation (Panth 2013; British Council 2014a; British Council 2014b), the work-readiness of graduates – the ability and capability to gain and maintain employment and obtain new employment when necessary (Hillage and Pollard 1998) – is yet to be a fully-fledged priority. Van Adams (2007) highlights four critical factors that influence employability: quality of education, work experience, training that fulfils labour market needs and labour market relevant policies.

Design/methodology/approach: World Economic Forum (WEF) data are analyzed using hedonic regression analysis to estimate which factors affect a country’s Global Gender Gap Index. Standardized β coefficients reveal the top five factors influencing the Index, just as key components of the US Consumer Price Index are teased out using this method. Findings: Women in public sector management, administration, and politics explain a substantial portion of gender inequality. Policies to increase women’s representation in parliaments, as heads of state, in ministerial positions, and in public sector management mitigate inequality as gauged by the Gender Gap Index. Economic indicators are also among the leading components of the Gender Gap Index. Research limitations/implications: Although comprehensive and drawn from several sources including the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, and the United Nations Development Programme, WEF data do not capture the full experience of women worldwide. Subsequent qualitative research is recommended. Practical implications: This analysis reveals policy recommendations for advocates working to close gender gaps, particularly in politics and economic outcomes. Increasing proportions of women in public sector management can mitigate inequality. This supports electoral quotas and human resource management initiatives to diversify management ranks. Social implications: Increasing women’s share of public sector managerial positions fosters gender equity, as does increasing women’s share of elected and appointed positions. Originality/value: This study provides quantitative evidence of the important role of women’s representation to guide subsequent fieldwork. This evidence supports efforts to increase women in elective office and public sector management. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Electoral quotas; Exploratory sequential research design; Global Gender Gap Index; Human resource management; Women; Women in public sector management",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The effects of pH and temperature on the performance of MO seeds in the treatment of contaminated water were studied. The MO seeds were able to cause appreciable reduction in colour, turbidity, total coliforms, and faecal conforms of approximately 97%, 93.75%, 85%, and 70%, respectively. Additionally, the MO seeds were able to achieve maximum turbidity reduction at an optimum pH of 7. Similarly, high temperature was found to increase the efficiency of MO seeds.

By focusing on the application of solar photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems in groundwater-fed agriculture, this paper highlights the need to further study the impacts, opportunities and limitations of this technology within the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus. It shows how most policies and projects promoting solar-based groundwater pumping for irrigation through subsidies and other incentives overlook the real financial and economic costs of this solution as well as the availability of water resources and the potential negative impacts on the environment caused by groundwater over-abstraction. There is a need to monitor groundwater abstraction, targeting subsidies and improving the knowledge and monitoring of resource use.

However, GREATEM field data usually includes mixed varied noises (white noise, sferics noise and human noise), which make identifying the exponential decaying signal too difficult. Traditional filtering methods mainly focus on suppressing specific noise types, which may cause the distortion of GREATEM signal, especially when the signal is affected by high residual sferics noise. This paper presents an exponential fitting-adaptive Kalman filter (EF-AKF) to remove mixed electromagnetic noises, while preserving the signal characteristics. The EF-AKF consists of an exponential fitting procedure and an adaptive scalar Kalman filter (SKF). The adaptive SKF uses the exponential fitting results in the weighting coefficients calculation. The EF-AKF is verified on an analytical three-layer model. It is compared with the SKF and wavelet threshold-exponential adaptive window width-fitting denoising algorithm (WEF) in synthetic data. The results showed that the EF-AKF outperformed the other methods in the noise reduction of GREATEM data.

According to the UNWTO (2016), it contributes 10% of global GDP (US$ 7 trillion), 5% of world exports (US$1.5 trillion) and one in 11 jobs worldwide. Ethiopia, the origin of humankind and the only un-colonized country in the continent of Africa, tops the list in the region having 12 UNESCO inscribed world heritage sites. However, the performance of the tourism sector in the country is very poor, and in terms of travel and tourism competitiveness, Ethiopia is ranked 118th out of 141 countries in 2015 (WB, 2012; MoCT, 2015 &amp; WEF, 2015). Cognizant of several reasons for this imbalance, the premise of this research was focused on a pre-assumption that either the tourism marketing strategy has been inappropriately formulated and implemented or even overlooked. A descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the tourism marketing practices of the government of Ethiopia. The tourism marketing strategy for Ethiopia (2016-2020) was critically reviewed and both strengths and weaknesses of the strategic document were identified. The study has revealed that the performance of tourism marketing practice is low (below regional average in most indicators), although the country has a good market growth rate. Notwithstanding a few pitfalls, the analysis showed that the existing tourism marketing strategy of the country was successfully formulated. It has been suggested that the government can concentrate more on the materialization of weak positions and modify the existing strategic documents accordingly so that the tourism marketing performance can improve. © 2017 AJHTL.","Ethiopia; Key performance indicators; Tourism; Tourism Marketing Strategy",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

As a country, Ireland came relatively late to the table with tackling gender equality, starting from a lower base than many of its peers in Europe, and although it took some considerable time for the gender equality agenda to take hold, it is now, according to the WEF Index, seen as a leader in the field. However, despite this leadership, Ireland still faces significant challenges in addressing inequalities in political and diplomatic leadership. Thus, despite Ireland’s high ranking, there remains much work to be done. The foreign service of a country should be representative of the country it serves, not just for the sake of it, but because diversity in decision making leads to better outcomes. However, even today, in 2017, there has never been a woman Secretary General in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Ireland. Furthermore, no woman has served as Head of Mission in key cities such as London, Ottawa, Canberra, Moscow, Rome, Berlin, Pretoria, or Brasilia. Only one woman Ambassador has served in the following posts: Washington, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and the European Union (and the same woman in all of these three posts), Warsaw, Beijing, Cairo, New Delhi, The Hague, and Tokyo.1 Furthermore, currently, there is only one permanent headquarters-based women members of the Management Board, the managing body of the Department. Therefore, if a foreign service should be representative of the country it represents then it is clear that the Irish Foreign Service has some road to travel. This book aims to analyse women's roles and impact in diplomacy, historically and in the present day. It is an attempt to rewrite the narrative of diplomacy, which has traditionally focused solely on male actors, by focusing on the women who have been integral to the diplomatic relations, international institutions, and foreign services across the world. As a contribution, this chapter focuses on the experiences of women diplomats who entered the Department (Ministry) of Foreign Affairs in Ireland from 1970 to the year 2000, both at the headquarter level and while serving abroad. It aims to illuminate the different barriers and challenges they faced during this period, identify where progress has been made, and highlight potential routes of further development towards ensuring gender equality in the Irish Foreign Service. The Irish case provides a highly interesting case study for analysis, as there are still women working in the system, or recently retired, who were junior diplomats before the issue of gender inequality in the service was even acknowledged, let alone addressed. An examination of the experiences of women diplomatic officers who entered and worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs during the period between 1970 and 2000, the content of this chapter is derived from a series of answers to an in-depth questionnaire conducted by the author. It is divided in five distinct, but interlocking, sections. First, the chapter sets out the methodology used at the core of this discussion. The second section addresses the importance of gender equality in the foreign service as whole. The third section reviews the historical and constitutional context in which the Irish diplomatic service has operated, and a number different economic, social, and political influences are discussed.

Furthermore, in order to reinforce all the positive achievements and to enhance the growth potential the ASEAN Economic Community was established in 2007. Thus, the competitiveness has been oficially set up as an integral part of the development strategy for the whole Southeast Asian region. Currently, the interrelation between economic development, competitiveness and progress within the ASEAN Economic Community has been recognized as essential by the researchers worldwide as well as by the policy-makers of ASEAN member countries. It has already become an inherent factor of economic policy. Because of the shortage of up-to-date statistical information the assessment of ASEAN competitiveness has been complicated. The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), a comprehensive tool developed by the World Economic Forum, remains the core reference in the analysis of all competitiveness-related subjects. At the same time, there is a more regional-specific Index elaborated by the Asia Competitiveness Institute. This local think tank utilizes a more nuanced and holistic approach to the assessment ASEAN member countries' competitiveness. The author presents an overview of the current status of ASEAN competitiveness' analysis and assessments. The advantages and limitations of the approaches used in the Global Competitiveness Index (WEF) and the ASEAN Competitiveness Index (Asia Competitiveness Institute) as well as the resulting implications for the policy-making are scrutinized. It is concluded that the benchmarks for the comprehensive competitiveness assessments have been shifted from global to regional and from short-term to long-term to reveal specific issues for ASEAN. The key achievements and omissions of each ASEAN country are considered through the impact of Asian crisis of 1997-1998 and Global crisis of 2008-2009.","ASEAN; ASEAN Competitiveness Index; ASEAN Economic Community; Asian crisis of 1997-1998; Competitiveness; Global Competitiveness Index; Global crisis of 2008-2009; Regional Economic integration",,,,,,,"Russian",Article,"Final","",Scopus

It was determined that the complaints were due to hydrogen sulfide odors from the effluent of the plant’s existing odor control scrubber. This scrubber processes foul air from the headworks and equalization tank. The Siesta Key WWTP has been in operation since the late 1960s, and is slated to be decommissioned within a year and a half and converted to a master pump station. However, the aging wet chemical scrubber has been struggling to handle increased hydrogen sulfide loadings, resulting in several complaints from the surrounding neighborhoods. A solution was necessary to mitigate these odors. Due to the short life span of the facility, improvements to the vapor-phase system were deemed cost-prohibitive. Therefore, a liquid phase treatment method was necessary for this application. Due to the nature of the upstream collection system, it was preferred to feed chemical directly into the force main discharge at the headworks. This feed configuration resulted in a detention time on the order of seconds, meaning any viable technology must be fast acting with rapid dissolution. Upon evaluating the conditions of the application, it was determined that a pH shift technology using a calcium hydroxide based slurry with a metabolic modifier would be excellent for controlling odors at the headworks and EQ tank, reducing the loadings on the chemical scrubber. Furthermore, this alkaline calcium hydroxide slurry rapidly dissolves in wastewater, providing an almost instantaneous effect at the application point. As a result, the calcium hydroxide slurry could be fed directly into the force main discharge at the headworks and have a significant impact on hydrogen sulfide concentrations at the plant. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a partially soluble, volatile gas notorious for causing offensive odors and corrosion in collection systems and treatment plants. While in an aqueous solution, H2S exists in equilibrium with two ionic forms: hydrosulfide (HS-) and sulfide (S=). These ionic compounds are completely non-volatile, and are unable to escape into the vapor phase or result in any offensive odors or corrosion issues. (WEF, 2001) At a neutral pH of 7.0, approximately 50% of the sulfide in solution will be in the H2S form, and can escape to the atmosphere causing odor and corrosion problems. By shifting the pH of the solution to nearly 8.3, more than 95% of sulfide will be trapped in solution as non-volatile ionic sulfides (EPA, 1985). Prior to chemical treatment, H2S loadings at the inlet of the scrubber averaged 75 ppm, while the outlet of the scrubber averaged 3.4 ppm with peaks up to 24 ppm. Based on the plant’s current flow rate of 4.9 ML/d (1.3 MGD) and an untreated pH of 7.4, approximately 757 L/d (200 GPD) of the calcium hydroxide slurry was fed into the headworks force main discharge. The solution was applied using an advanced dosing controller to match dose-to-demand and maintain a relatively constant wastewater pH. Once optimized, an average pH of 8.2 was achieved. H2S loadings to the inlet of the scrubber were reduced to 5.8 ppm, with 0 ppm from the scrubber outlet, effectively eliminating odors in the surrounding area. This paper describes the investigation methods used to quantify the problem, the implementation and optimization of the resultant solution, and presents the results of the optimized process.

Based on the interaction of WEF-Nexus with population system, economic system, and environmental system, this paper builds the input output index system at the city level. Using the input output index system, we evaluate the WEF-Nexus input-output efficiency with the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model.

Russia has no shortage of regions with visibly high potential for developing tourism, yet there are a number of problems, characteristic of Russia, which impede its progress: malnourished tourism coupled with an unsophisticated infrastructure, a shortage of personnel, weak marketing, a gloomy business climate, and a lack of adequate regulatory frameworks. Be this as it may, the slump, rather than being a hindrance, should be considered a fresh opportunity for the Russian tourism sector. Russia has been ranked 45th in the latest edition of the biennial Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, improving its performance by 18 points from its 2013 ranking of 63rd. The ranking, which includes 141 countries, is compiled by the World Economic Forum and Strategy Partners Group every two years, and assesses ""the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country."" In 2013, the WEF cited hefty prices as one of the main disadvantages of the Russian tourist market. The availability of natural and cultural heritage sites has ensured additional points for Russia in the overall ranking; in these areas the country ranked 34th and 21st, respectively. Tours to Russia have become more affordable following the recent devaluation of the ruble - the value of the national currency against the U.S. dollar has fallen by 44 percent since May 2014. As a result, accommodation in hotels has become markedly cheaper. In addition, the consultants noted an improvement in air links (22nd).

To holistically address such problems, cities need to transform planning, governance and regulatory aspects, while further strengthening the use of technology. The action plan proposed by WEF contains tens steps that city managers need to consider when aiming to change the way urban services are delivered. The first step is 'Identify DNA', i.e. the city's key characteristics. That uniqueness needs to be strengthened through innovative use of urban services. The next steps are 'Identify Challenges', 'Develop a Shared Vision', 'Identify and Prioritise Goals' and 'Develop Programmes'. In the subsequent step, cities that are embracing technology-enabled urban services are also advised to 'Revisit Regulations' concerning data sharing, privacy and the sharing economy. 'Develop Capacity' is the next step; besides the development of management and technical capabilities, champions for the initiative need to be identified. Then, 'Financing and Funding' must of course be tackled and 'Quick Wins' need to be targeted in order to build the city's brand and attract best people, solutions and capital.

However, little information is available on the effect of WEF on skeletal muscle, which depends primarily on intracellular Ca2+ stores for function and metabolism. Here, we examine the effects of 30 min exposure of rat primary myotube cultures to WEF (1.75 μT, 16 Hz) on Ca2+ handling and creatine kinase (CK) release. Free myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+ i]) was measured with the ratiometric dye indo-1. WEF did not affect basal [Ca2+]i but decreased the twitch [Ca2+]i transient in a time-dependent manner, and the twitch amplitude was decreased to ∼30 % after 30 min. WEF completely abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by potassium chloride (∼60 mM) but had no effect on the increase induced by caffeine (∼6 mM). Hypoxia (2 h exposure to 100 % argon) resulted in a marked loss of CK into the medium (400 % of normoxic value), as well as a rapid (within 20 min) and sustained increase in basal [Ca2+]i (∼20 % above baseline). However, during exposure to WEF, basal [Ca2+]i remained constant during the initial 60 min of hypoxia and, thereafter, increased to levels similar to those observed in the absence of WEF. Finally, WEF blocked about 80 % of hypoxia-mediated CK release (P &lt; 0.05). These data demonstrate that WEF inhibits increases in [Ca2+]i by interfering with muscle excitation and protects against muscle damage induced by hypoxia. Thus, WEF may have therapeutic/protective effects on skeletal muscle. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Caffeine; Creatine kinase; Hypoxia; KCl; Muscle contraction; Myotubes","caffeine; calcium; creatine kinase; indo-1; indole derivative; animal; calcium signaling; drug effects; electromagnetism; hypoxia; metabolism; muscle contraction; physiology; rat; skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle cell; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Caffeine; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Creatine Kinase; Electromagnetic Fields; Hypoxia; Indoles; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle, Skeletal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Residue treatments were: control (no residue removal), light grazing (2.5 animal unit months [AUM] ha-1), heavy grazing (5.0 AUM ha-1), and baling. We simulated soil loss for a 3-h windstorm with a wind velocity of 13 m s-1. Soil properties differed in spring but not in fall. Baling reduced 6.3-to 45-mm macroaggregates by 37% and GMD by 80% and increased WEF by 25% relative to the control. Light and heavy grazing, after 8 yr, significantly reduced 6.3-to 14-mm macroaggregates 43% compared with the control and tended to reduce GMD and increase WEF, although not statistically significant. As residue cover decreased, GMD decreased and WEF increased. Residue removal did not reduce SOC and POM concentrations, but soil erodibility decreased as POM increased. Simulation showed that soil erodibility increased as residue cover decreased in spring, and baling increased the wind erosion potential.

Design/methodology/approach: This research drew its data from various sources, including the World Economic Forum (WEF) data set, the World Bank Report on Observation of Standards and Codes, the World Development Indicators and the Economic Intelligence Unit Report on Democracy Index on 50 countries classified as IFSCs. The adoption status is then regressed on a number of variables of interest. To establish that the results are robust, the authors used a combination of different regression techniques comprising OLS, multinomial and logistic regressions. Findings: In addition to the gross domestic product growth and education level, this paper adds new evidence to the literature by reporting the positive association between the level of democracy and the enforcement of securitiesâ€™ regulation on ISA adoption. It argues that political, economic, social and legal factors impact on ISA adoption in the IFSCs. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is limited to 50 from a population of 99 IFSCs because of the lack of data. Some of the independent variables are basically archival data. Reliance is placed on WEF with regard to the measurement of protection of minority interest, securities and exchange regulations and on the Economic Intelligence Unit for democracy index.

To address these impacts, many programs exist to promote improved land-use practices in agriculture; however, where these practices incur a cost or other burden to the farmer, adoption can be low unless some form of incentive is provided (as in a payment for ecosystem services (PES) program). Provision of such incentives can be a challenge to sustain in the long term, if there is not a clear beneficiary or other actor willing to provide them. Successfully closing the loop between impacts and incentives often requires identifying a measurable and valuable service with a clear central beneficiary that is impacted by the summative effects of the diffuse agricultural practices across the landscape. Drawing on cases from our own research, we demonstrate how the WEF Nexus perspective—by integrating non-point-source agricultural problems under well-defined energy issues—can highlight central beneficiaries of improved agricultural practice, where none may have existed otherwise. © 2016, AESS.","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Hydropower; Integrated pest management; Payment for ecosystem services; Systems thinking; Water-energy-food nexus","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural practice; cost analysis; ecosystem service; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental issue; food security; hydroelectric power; incentive; integrated pest management; land use; systems analysis; water quality; willingness to pay",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The Brahmaputra River Basin in South Asia, home for 130 million people, is such a basin. Development of new hydropower projects, upstream water diversions and possible climate changes introduce concerns among riparian countries about future water supply for energy and food production in the basin. This study presents a new hydro-economic water system model of the basin coupled with ex post scenario analysis under the ""nexus thinking"" concept to identify and illustrate where development paths are in conflict. Results indicate that the ability of future development to remain free of conflict hinges mostly on the amount of precipitation falling in the basin in the future. Uncertain future precipitation along with uncertain future temperature and the unknown amount of upstream water diversion combine to strongly influence future water, energy and food production in the basin. Specifically, decreases in precipitation coupled with large upstream diversions (e.g., diversion in the territory of China) would leave one or more riparian countries unable to secure enough water to produce their desired energy and food. Future climate projected by General Circulation Models suggest a warmer and wetter climate condition in the region, which is associated with an increase in streamflow and easing of conflicts at the WEF nexus in the basin. The methodology presented here is expected to be generally useful for diagnosing the conditions that may cause water resources development goals to not be achieved due to either changes in climate or water use among competing users. © 2016.","Ex post scenario analysis; The jamuna river; The yarlung tsangpo river; Transboundary water management; Water resources systems analysis","analytical method; climate change; economic analysis; food production; future prospect; hydroelectric power plant; precipitation assessment; streamflow; transboundary cooperation; water management; water resource; water supply; water use; Bangladesh; Brahmaputra Basin; Jamuna River; South Asia",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus

One of the problems that memoization brings to such systems is the memory overhead which may be a bottleneck. In this work we propose policies that decide what types of concept descriptors to store in memotables and for how long to keep them. The proposed policies have been implemented as extensions to a concept discovery system called Tabular CRIS wEF, and the resulting system is named Policy-based Tabular CRIS.

Anglo-Saxon countries rank second academically behind East Asia, but in terms of competitiveness, the Anglo-Saxon cluster ranks first. We show that Anglo-Saxon countries' leadership in education and competitiveness have been challenged by East Asia. Our diachronic analysis shows that together with Competitive Industrial Performance, the cultural dimensions of Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-term Orientation and Indulgence Restraint, Education contributes to improvements in Competitiveness.

Facilities evaluating PAA disinfection as a treatment option can benefit from case study examples; as a result, the Disinfection and Public Health Committee has proposed a special WEF publication on the topic. The publication will include a summary of site-specific factors such as compliance goals, operations and maintenance, the willingness of a particularly facility to take on risks associated with implementation of a new technology, as well as costs. With the increasing body of knowledge on this topic, it is also important to identify what else is needed for implementation of this technology and these considerations will be outlined in this presentation.

The research was carried out on a sample of Central and Eastern European (CEE) member states of the European Union (EU). The analysis shows that economic growth as measured by GDP per capita growth rates, and global competitiveness of a country as measured by the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index scores’ growth rates, are positively related to each other. The comparative analysis also reveals that efficiency-driven and certain transition CEE EU Member States have made the highest progress at various competitiveness pillars, which is reflected in their economic growth. The opposite has been found for two innovation-driven CEE EU Member States. When testing the hypothesis on the relationship between the average growth of quality of early-stage entrepreneurship indices and average growth of GDP per capita, no significant relationship was found. This finding is in accordance with the general thesis that entrepreneurial activity supports economic growth only as part of a favourable broader business environment.

The Part 25, Appendix O is developed to define a representative icing environment for super-cooled large drops. Super-cooled large drops, which include freezing drizzle and freezing rain conditions, are not included in Appendix C. This paper reports results from recent glaze icing scaling tests conducted in NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) to evaluate how well the scaling methods recommended for Appendix C conditions might apply to SLD conditions. The models were straight NACA 0012 wing sections. The reference model had a chord of 72 in and the scale model had a chord of 21 in. Reference tests were run with airspeeds of 100 and 130.3 knots and with MVD’s of 85 and 170 μm. Two scaling methods were considered. One was based on the modified Ruff method with scale velocity found by matching the Weber number WeL. The other was proposed and developed by Feo specifically for strong glaze icing conditions, in which the scale liquid water content and velocity were found by matching reference and scale values of the non-dimensional water-film thickness expression and the film Weber number Wef. All tests were conducted at 0° AOA. Results will be presented for stagnation freezing fractions of 0.2 and 0.3. For non-dimensional reference & scale ice shape comparison, a new post-scanning ice shape digitization procedure was developed for extracting 2-D ice shape profiles at any selected span-wise location from the high fidelity 3-D scanned ice shapes obtained in the IRT. © 2016, National Research Council Canada.",,"Density measurement (optical); Drops; Freezing; Glazes; NASA; Dimensional reference; Freezing fractions; Icing conditions; Liquid water content; Reference modeling; Shape comparison; U.S. Department of Transportation; Water film thickness; Ice",,"8th AIAA Atmospheric and Space Environments Conference, 2016","13 June 2016 through 17 June 2016",,175879,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

The study included 13 litters (78 pigs) of Mangalitsa reared in the traditional system (MTS) and 13 litters (98 pigs) reared in the modern system (MMS). In the rearing phase there were 60 MTS piglets and 90 MMS piglets, and in the fattening phase 53 MTS pigs and 71 MMS pigs. Genetic parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedure based on an animal model with multivariate analyses. Results indicated a significant advantage of growth intensity in certain phases of rearing MMS in relation to MTS. Compared to the MTS piglets, the MMS piglets achieved 2.18 kg higher body weight at suckling and 7.02 kg higher body weight at the end of rearing, and fattening was 56 days shorter. At the end of fattening, the MMS fatlings at age of 255 days achieved body weight of 96.50 kg, while the MTS fatlings at age of 311 days achieved average body weight of 93.04 kg.

Inequality indeed matters and there is a rich literature investigating its relationship with economic development. Okun (1975) argues that in pursuing increased economic efficiency, trade-offs in terms of increased inequality may be necessary to facilitate capital accumulation and technological innovation and encourage economic agents to invest in education and health. There is a larger body of literature, however, that highlights the long-term negative effects of increasing income inequality on sustainable and inclusive development. In their study of 174 countries, Berg and Ostry (2011) contend that countries with lower income inequality enjoy higher growth rates in the long run, after controlling for market structure and other institutional factors. Bénabou (1996) also shows that economic growth in countries with high income inequality is slower than economies with lower levels of inequality. It has been further argued that inequality is associated with business recessions and economic crises. For example, income inequality and the ratio of debt to income saw rapid increases before both the Great Depression of the 1930s and the 2007-2008 Great Recession (Kumhof et al. 2015). By increasing concentration of income, inequality can reduce aggregate demand in an economy, leading to recession. This is mainly due to the lower marginal propensity to consume associated with the wealthy in comparison to middle- and lower-income groups (Carvalho and Rezai 2014). In explaining the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, deepening income inequality has indeed been highlighted as a major culprit (see Stiglitz 2012). Inequality affects the poor by reducing their ability to invest in their health and human capital formation (Galor and Moav 2004; Aghion et al. 1999). It also influences social mobility across generations, as children’s future earnings are significantly affected by their parents’ earning profiles (Corak 2013). Finally, it has been shown that inequality damages economic growth through intensifying conflicts and political stability. Increasing inequality reduces the opportunity cost of engaging in conflicts (Lichbach 1989). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",,,,,,,,"English",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

Some practices are accepted much faster than others and some practices require research and development of an underlying technology before they can be realized. Examples of innovate practices in the Infiltration/Inflow (I/I) field that depend upon some underlying technology are flow metering to locate sewersheds with high I/I, Hydraulic Modeling to predict the effect of I/I, and Radar Rainfall to provide more accurate knowledge of rainfall. When the practice of I/I reduction was born in the 1970’s the normal procedure was to use a combination of Smoke Testing, Dye Water Flooding and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) to look for defects where presumably water was entering the sewer. Defects that were discovered were repaired and the Owner took credit for I/I reduction. Collectively known as the Sewer System Evaluation Survey (SSES), these projects soon gained a reputation of not accomplishing the I/I reduction that was expected. Many theories were developed to explain the failure, including I/I migration, differing antecedent rainfall conditions and varying ground water levels. In retrospect, it is clear from several years of project experience that these techniques suffered from False Negatives; the absence of a visible defect, an observed leak or smoke plume incorrectly led the investigator to believe that no defect (I/I source) existed. It was rare to see an SSES project that could remove more than 30% of I/I in a sewer system. Today, better flow metering in uniform-sized basins, more sophisticated computer models and easy-to-acquire radar rainfall have all combined to achieve more than 30% reduction with a few projects achieving 60% and 70% reduction. Practitioners struggle with what the missing piece may be. It is work on private property? Is it better rehabilitation technology? Or is it better diagnostics? For the last few years at the WEF Collection System Conference workshops and at workshops at WEFTEC, the terms ‘micro-monitoring’ and ‘micro-metering’ have been increasingly discussed as an effective diagnostic tool for locating sources of I/I. In common usage these terms are used interchangeably. The question often asked “is micro-metering a Principle, a Practice and a Product”? The answer is that is all three and this paper addresses the three different aspects of micro-monitoring or micro-metering.

The COST C27 Action aimed to investigate “the range of threats to sustainable development faced by small communities and rural areas and the planning tools developed for them” as well as “the use of suitable indicators and parameters (planning tools, specific technical improvements) to analyze and assess the best practice case studies..” SDPMDUC topics, especially the growing environmental degradation and “severe income disparities, food crises and dysfunctional cities,” (WEF 2014) are crucial to the contemporary world’s economic critical asset. Moreover, it is well-known that the economic crisis affects not only developing countries but also concerns developed countries and even their wealthy areas. SDPMDUC therapies, or best practices, look at development perspectives that are quite different from “normal” ones. The Degrowth theory, for instance, which systematically criticizes the lack of a more comprehensive economic interpretation of current economic phenomena, proposes new tasks and actions. Deprivation phenomena are currently particularly acute because of the main facts that we assume to having been fully demonstrated: for instance, the pioneer research performed by Meadows et al. for the Club of Rome in 1972; the ever widening gap between gross domestic product and the index of well-being in rich societies after the 1970s; the growth of inequalities in terms of social and economic cleavages; the hopelessness of a constantly developing society. COST C27 research suggests a methodology to build a framework of knowledge by using and improving a varied and integrated system of analysis, synthesis, and monitoring tools. Case studies highlight, detect, and define good and coherent policies and practices in planning strategy and territorial government. One of the main topics is related to tourism-development experiences. For many territories that are rich in environmental, cultural, urban, historical, and particular social resources, tourism represents an opportunity for economic development along with risks, contradictions and threats. C27 research shows that government land use actions, including laissez faire ones, have a strong influence on development and deprivation. They can create conditions and improve tools to orient the way in which resources are used by both resident and occasional population. Only coordinated improved planning strategy action can generate long-term effects and social, economic, and beneficial environmental consequences. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Deprivation; Minor communities; Natural and cultural heritage; Sustainable development",,,,,,,"English",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

According to World Economic Forum's (WEF) report, Egypt's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) was 81 out of 139 in 2011. The Country's GCI dropped to 116 out of 140 in 2015. This was mainly due to the political and economic instability that Egypt has come across over the past four years. Over the last few decades, the creation and utilization of technologies have played a critical role to improve the life quality of people, advance economies, and open new horizons for individuals, businesses, and even nations around the world. Furthermore, the world is experiencing nowadays unprecedented technology disruption that has triggered an enormous change; a change that is fueled by ongoing nonstop innovation and substantial evolution in the means people employ technology. Consequently, nations, individuals and businesses not only need to be aware of that, but also need to be ready, in order to be competitive in a connected and competitive world. Therefore, competitiveness becomes the name of the game for the nations, individuals and businesses. Without focus and disruptive strategy and implementation plans, it would be difficult to have a real competitive Egypt. Thus, the paper examines how Egypt could build its competitiveness pyramid by utilizing appropriate technologies to advance on the global competitiveness ladder and realize its growth potential; technologies that are matching the country's capabilities and resources. The approach used in the paper is based on thorough analysis of the reports issued by international and Egyptian institutions in the areas of competitiveness and sustainable socioeconomic development, desk research, and interviews with key personnel in the government, Business Representative Organizations (BROs), NGOs and private sector, in addition to youth, startups and entrepreneurs. Based on that approach, the paper draws a model for building ecosystems and clusters on the local governorates level, as each governorate has its own characteristic, competitiveness readiness, competitive edge, competences, and socioeconomic circumstances. A model that is considering the appropriate technologies needed to increase the competitiveness readiness on the local governorates' level, as well as, advancing and connecting the local business communities, youth, entrepreneurs and startups to seize the new opportunities that would be developed. Moreover, the paper highlights the Critical Success Factors (CSF) for such model. That's why, each governorate or region would form an economic hub by itself, based on the previously mentioned notion. Eventually, these local ecosystems, clusters and economic hubs would be interconnected and integrated for serving the ultimate objective of increasing Egypt's GCI. The paper sets an example that can be deployed in similar economies, based on the proper definition of local competences, and building sustainable economic hubs, which are utilizing appropriate technologies and engaging the developed workforce in connected clusters and business communities.","Appropriate Technologies; Clusters; Competitiveness; Economic and Social Impact of Technology Development; Management of Technology","Competition; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Industrial management; Societies and institutions; Appropriate technologies; Clusters; Competitiveness; Management of technology; Social impact-of-technology; Economic and social effects","","25th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2016","15 May 2016 through 19 May 2016",,123391,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Contamination of groundwater, surface and drinking water as well as of aquatic sediments and soils with pharmaceuticals has been reported (Hamscher et al. in Analytical Chemistry 74:1509–1518, 2002; Hirsch et al. in Science of the Total Environment 225:109–118, 1999; Kümmerer in Pharmaceuticals in the environment. Sources, fate, effects and risks. Springer, Heidelberg, 2001b; Ternes in Water Research 32:3245–3260, 1998). According to available data, biodegradation is more the exception than the rule, which is one reason for the widespread occurrence of these compounds in the environment (Kümmerer in Chemosphere 45:957–969, 2001a). Antibiotics and disinfectants are especially designed to have a strong impact on microorganisms, making environmental effects very likely to occur. Therefore it is necessary to consider possible risks of using secondary raw materials containing such xenobiotics despite their advantages as a fertilizer or source of organic material. For many organic contaminants no environmental risk assessment (ERA) is available. For veterinary drugs, a note of guidance on ERA was issued in January 1998 but hardly any eco-toxicological data are available for products approved before 1998 (Baguer et al. in Chemosphere 40:751–757, 2000; EU in EMEA/CVMP/055/96. EMEA, London, 1996) or for human therapeutics. For many pharmaceuticals as well as organic chemicals their environmental effects are quite unknown, particularly any interactions. New technologies enabling the detection of traces of organic xenobiotics and their metabolites even in critical matrices (slurry, sewage sludge) are partly responsible for the higher awareness of possible risks. Environmental tests on the effects of xenobiotics are still rare and have only been performed in the last decade and mainly for aquatic organisms. It is the aim of this chapter to give an overview of the different classes of organic contamination that are relevant in organic P fertilizers. Moreover technical solutions to decrease or minimize the risk of soil contaminations by using organic P fertilizers are discussed and the different recycling materials are evaluated with respect to their environmental risks. It is not possible to address all different organic compounds and their impact on the environment in one chapter because of the sheer number of compounds and metabolites. The focus was put on the input of pharmaceutical contamination into agriculture because sewage sludge and farmyard manures are important organic P fertilizers, which can contain high amounts of pharmaceuticals. But even so this field is too large to cover the whole spectrum taking into account that in Germany alone 50,000 drugs are registered for human use, containing more than 3000 different active compounds (Kümmerer in Pharmaceuticals in the environment. Sources, fate, effects and risks. Springer, Heidelberg, 2001b). In order to illustrate the general problems arising from field application of environmentally relevant substances, two main classes of contaminants were discussed in detail: antibiotics and substances with an endocrine potential. For more detailed information several extensive review articles and books are available covering the different aspects of pharmaceutical drugs in the environment, their occurrence and behavior in the environment, their chemical characteristics, and their impact on soil organisms, plant growth and aquatic life (Boxall et al. in Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology 180:1–91, 2004; Halling-Sørensen et al. in Chemosphere 36:357–393, 1998; Kümmerer in Pharmaceuticals in the environment.

Pathogens, another important possible organic contamination of secondary P fertilizers, were also not addressed in detail, as the topic is comprehensive enough to fill books on its own (e.g. Bowman in Manure pathogens: manure management, regulations, and water quality protection.

Public concerns in two states have led to scrutiny of biosolids recycling: New York has just witnessed interpretations of biosolids regulations and right to farm laws, and Maine legislature is considering even stricter new odor regulations that focus on biosolids and septage processing. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has finalized its Produce Safety Regulations that support the use of biosolids. And the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized the electronic reporting rule, which requires electronic filing of NPDES permit reports, including annual February 19 biosolids reports, likely effective in 2017. At the same time, other organic ""wastes"" (residuals)- food scraps in particular-are the focus of state regulatory programs, including nation-leading bans on landfill disposal of food scraps in Massachusetts and Vermont. Add to all this another factor: controlling phosphorus (P) and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen (N) from non-point sources. EPA just finalized the TMDL for the Vermont portion of Lake Champlain, and the state adopted a major ""Water Quality Act."" Meanwhile, new Massachusetts agriculture regulations potentially prohibit many applications to soils of biosolids and other organic residuals.

A major proportion of the human populace depends on the use of traditional knowledge about the consumption of medicinal plants for many diseases, including DDs. The contemporary study summarizes the indigenous uses of Wild Edible Fruits (WEFs) of Swat Valley used for DDs and to evaluate the bio-efficacy of these pharmacologically essential fruit species from the available literature. Material and methods An ethnomedicinal study was conducted in Swat valley, Northern Pakistan. Data was collected through field assessment as well as from traditional healers and local people by means of personal interviews and semi-structured questionnaires, giving value to both rural and urban communities. The ethnomedicinal knowledge was quantitatively analysed using various indices like Familiarity Index (FI), Consensus index (CI), Informant consensus factor (ICF) and the present data was compared with previous studies in the neighbouring areas using Jaccard similarity coefficient (JI). Results The present study recorded use reports on 53 WEFs of ethnomedicinal prominence in the treatment of DDs, belonging to 23 families. The recurrent growth forms were trees (51%) shrubs (38%) and herbs (11%). High consumption of fruits (50%), leaves (27%) and flowers (12%) was recorded. The traditional preparations were mostly in the form of unprocessed dried/fresh, powder, Juice and decoction and were usually taken orally. Almost 20-30% of the plants occurred in synanthropic vegetation while more than 75% were found in natural woodland and grassland vegetation. Family Berberidaceae dominated with highest FIV (41) followed by Punicaceae (38), Oxalidaceae (36) and Moraceae (35). ICF values for carminative (0.6) showed high consensus factor followed by anthelmintic, gastroenteritis and intestinal disorders (0.5). FI value is high for Berberis lycium (0.5), Morus alba (0.5), Morus nigra (0.5) followed by Olea ferruginea (0.45). B. lycium had the high consensus index, whereas, a study conducted on Lesser Himalayas Pakistan showed high value of Jaccard similarity coefficient. Conclusion WEFs are predominantly used in the treatment of various diseases in the valley and traditional knowledge about the use of these species against DDs is still prevailing. Multiple uses of these WEFs suggest further investigation into its phytochemical, toxicological and pharmaceutical potential. This study will serve as a baseline data for future pharmacological studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To understand the potential impacts of wind energy facilities (WEF) post-construction (i.e., operation and maintenance) on wildlife, we compared differences in activity centers and survivorship of Agassiz’s desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) inside or near a WEF to neighboring tortoises living near a wilderness area (NWA) and farther from the WEF. We found that the size of tortoise activity centers varied, but not significantly so, between the WEF (6.25 ± 2.13 ha) and adjacent NWA (4.13 ± 1.23 ha). However, apparent survival did differ significantly between the habitat types: over the 18-year study period apparent annual survival estimates were 0.96 ± 0.01 for WEF tortoises and 0.92 ± 0.02 for tortoises in the NWA. High annual survival suggests that operation and maintenance of the WEF has not caused considerable declines in the adult population over the past two decades. Low traffic volume, enhanced resource availability, and decreased predator populations may influence annual survivorship at this WEF. Further research on these proximate mechanisms and population recruitment would be useful for mitigating and managing post-development impacts of utility-scale wind energy on long-lived terrestrial vertebrates. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Activity center; Desert tortoise; Gopherus agassizii; Landscape disturbance; Renewable energy","Ecosystems; Landforms; Maintenance; Wind power; Activity centers; Desert tortoise; Gopherus agassizii; Landscape disturbance; Renewable energies; Animals; animal; construction work and architectural phenomena; desert climate; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; physiology; population dynamics; renewable energy; survival rate; turtle; United States; wild animal; wind; Animals; Animals, Wild; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Facility Design and Construction; Population Dynamics; Renewable Energy; Southwestern United States; Survival Rate; Turtles; Wind",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

It is widespread not only in drylands and cropped areas, but in most agro-ecologies and biomes around the world. Unless addressed, it may undermine global food security and negatively affect the livelihoods of billions of people, especially of the poor. Addressing land degradation requires public, community and private actions informed and supported by evidence-based research. The current paper reviews the recent economic literature on land degradation and improvement with the purpose of highlighting major new insights and continuing gaps. Drawing conclusions from the recent research under the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, we find that action against land degradation has considerably higher economic, environmental and social returns than inaction. The drivers of land degradation are numerous and often context-specific, so addressing them requires targeting not some individual driver in isolation, but through comprehensive and mutually consistent packages of policy actions. We suggest the following conceptual, methodological and empirical areas for future research on economics of land degradation. Firstly, more interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks are required to connect land degradation and other intricately related issues such as climate change, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, energy and food security. In this regard, Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus concept can be highly useful as one of such nexus platforms for future trans-disciplinary research on economics of land degradation. Secondly, more rigorous methodologies are needed on the incorporation of the value of ecosystem services into economic calculations. Finally, there is a need for empirical studies tracing the dynamic economic and social impacts of land degradation across scales: from household to global level. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,"action plan; biodiversity; climate change; economic analysis; ecosystem service; energy use; environmental economics; food security; future prospect; land degradation; land management; policy development; soil degradation; sustainability; water use",,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus

The WEF nexus has been promoted through international meetings and calls for new research agendas. It is clear from the literature that many aims of nexus approaches pre-date the recent nexus agenda; these have encountered significant barriers to progress, including challenges to cross-disciplinary collaboration, complexity, political economy (often perceived to be under-represented in nexus research) and incompatibility of current institutional structures. Indeed, the ambitious aims of the nexus-the desire to capture multiple interdependencies across three major sectors, across disciplines and across scales-could become its downfall. However, greater recognition of interdependencies across state and non-state actors, more sophisticated modelling systems to assess and quantify WEF linkages and the sheer scale of WEF resource use globally, could create enough momentum to overcome historical barriers and establish nexus approaches as part of a wider repertoire of responses to global environmental change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"energy resource; environmental change; food security; political economy; theoretical study; water resource",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

The question is relevant in relation to the diversity of effects that the crisis had on EU member states, including, the different levels of real economy adjustment constraints. Design/methodology/approach – The concept of competitiveness applied by the World Economic Forum (WEF)in constructing the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) was used. Based on selectedWEF GCI sub-indicators and the WEF’s methodology, we a new index named “Ability to attract intellectual capital” was generated. EU member states’ performance was compared along this indicator for the 2007-2008 (pre-crisis) and the 2013-2014 (post-crisis) periods. In this way, EU member states can be ranked before and after the crisis; their performance can be compared in the two periods, relatively to each other, and in relation to their performance along other relevant indices. Findings – The findings show interesting results. First, many peripheral EU member states, deeply affected by the crisis, could considerably improve their relative positions between 2007 and 2013. Second, the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries show a rather mixed picture, drawing up rather different individual development paths. Third, the advancements in some countries do not imply that overall convergence is proceeding in the EU. Nevertheless, some countries have not wasted the “good” crisis to take those steps of structural reform. Research limitations/implications – Because we only look at two time periods (pre-and post-crisis), the authors are not able to describe the processes that were going on in the EU member states during the years of the crisis; the results can only show the difference between the two periods. Furthermore, there may be other methodological approaches to countries’ abilities to attract intellectual capital that may bring results different from this study’s results. For the countries who, according to our investigations, could improve these abilities, enhanced competitiveness is likely to occur in a few years’ time. Practical implications – For those countries aiming at improving their abilities to attract intellectual capital, or for EU policy design, this research may provide useful results. Moreover, not only this study’s results but also the methodology can be used by others, for other purposes: to compare different years, different sets of countries included in the WEF GCI or even along different dimensions. Social implications – This study’s research findings, the authors believe, will help EU member states and the EU as a whole in getting to know their abilities to attract intellectual capital better. In the introductory part of this paper, the aim was also to collect arguments from the economic theory to explain why such abilities are crucial for future competitiveness of countries. Originality/value – The methodology that was used is the adoption of WEF methodology, and the data are from the WEF GCI dataset. However, to the authors’s knowledge, no other research work has applied this methodology on this set of WEF GCI sub-indicators, with such purposes as to compare EU member states’ abilities to attract intellectual capital before and after the crisis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Competitive structure; European union; Innovation and R&D",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Firstly, the impact of WEF on the relays coordination is focused, after that we search for the new relays setting to ensure an optimal coordination of the relays. The coordination problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear mono-objective optimization problem. The objective function of this optimization problem is the minimization of the operation time of the associated relays. In terms of decision variables; two types of optimizations are considered in this paper, namely: real parameter optimization where, the time dial setting (TDS), and the pickup current setting (IP) are considered as the real decision variables of the optimization problem and the mixed integer optimization, where the IEC curve characteristic of each relay is added to the previous variables as an integer decision variable. The characteristics of the relays are always chosen arbitrary or by trial and error method. To solve this constrained non linear optimization problem, the particle swarm optimization method is used. The proposed method is validated on IEEE 8-bus power transmission test systems considering various scenarios.","Directional overcurrent protection; Fault current; Mixed integer constrained optimization; Optimal coordination; Particle swarm optimization; Wind energy farms","Algorithms; Constrained optimization; Curve fitting; Decision making; Electric fault currents; Electric relays; Integer programming; Inverse problems; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Overcurrent protection; Wind power; Constrained non-linear optimizations; Directional over-current relays; Directional overcurrent protection; Mixed integer; Optimal coordination; Particle swarm optimization method; Pickup current settings (Ip); Real-parameter optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

First, a range of flow frequency relationships for typical urban catchments were developed using continuous hydrologic modeling with USEPA’s SWMM5 software to establish desired flow management objectives for an urban catchment. Next, the SWMM5 routines for modeling LID Controls were used to represent a range of design configurations for a generic bioretention cell, including surface area/depth, soil type / depth, subsurface storage, and underdrain size / offset. Nineteen years of rainfall data were used to determine the parameters with the largest influence on design goals.

Funding program changes can occur reactively or proactively. Many user-fee funded stormwater programs are initially established to fund a driving purpose such as compliance with regulatory requirements, the need for better maintenance of best management practices (BMPs) that are not being maintained by private entities, or the need to finance significant capital facilities. Changing needs and demands require periodic evaluation of a stormwater program to address additional activities and increased stakeholder expectations. With nearly 1,500 user-fee-funded programs in North America, a structured method of program evaluation and improvement is very much needed. Program evaluation can be accomplished in a variety of ways and to a varying degree of detail. The question and issue becomes: How is this best accomplished? The Water Environment Federation (WEF) recently published ""User-Fee Funded Stormwater Programs"" (WEF 2013). This publication not only updates information on the state of the art for these programs, but has added an important chapter specifically addressing the evaluation and improvement of existing stormwater funded programs. This paper presents the rationale and method developed to address program review and enhancement as described in this important Chapter of the aforementioned publication. More specifically the paper provides a structured method and ""score card"" tool designed to assess an existing user-fee funded stormwater program and to develop a proactive plan of action for overall stormwater management program improvement. The methodology will provide the practitioner with an assessment of an existing program sufficient to identify functions and program components that may need to be changed, adjusted, or otherwise improved. Application and use of the score card to assess and determine specific action plans to enhance and improve the existing program will be demonstrated. A simple but highly useful scoring methodology developed for assessment and determination of actionable improvements are discussed. The assessment is organized into three primary program areas: 1. Functional elements 2. Revenue elements 3. Management elements The separate scoring of these three program areas avoids strength in one area to distort or cover potential weaknesses in another. The reviewer is able to assess these three significant program components to provide a focused assessment. You will learn: 1. Why program evaluation is needed; 2. What elements of the program should be assessed; 3. What elements of the program need attention; 4. What specific improvements should be made; 5. Who should conduct the assessment; 6. How the assessment is to be made; 7. When the assessment is to be made; and 8. How to use the results of the assessment.

A national survey recently collected input on barriers from more than 110 wastewater service utilities. A concurrent utility focus group process captured detailed experiences. Motivation is a crucial precondition for energy efficiency. The utilities reported that the strongest motivators for utility staff are (1) reductions in energy expenditures and (2) prioritization by utility management. The project identified the following key barriers: ♦ Capital projects. Economic barriers dominate: inadequate financial feasibility, lack of funding, and resource competition with other organizational priorities. ♦ Operations optimization. Operational conservatism (desire for a margin of safety for permit compliance) is the strongest barrier to implementing operating changes that conserve energy. ♦ Maintenance for energy efficiency. Many utilities have not optimized maintenance intervals for energy efficiency because they prioritize more pressing maintenance activities. The barriers considered by this research include both internal and external challenges. Internal challenges are mitigated by well-developed energy programs, as gauged by the level of implementation of the approaches outlined in the WEF Energy Roadmap. Utilities with well-developed programs perceive barriers to energy efficiency initiatives as being lower. External challenges are reduced for water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) in states with well-funded and accessible energy incentive programs and less-inhibitive energy policies.

The rats were orally administered of the water decoction and different splitted fractions of Poria, purified water was used as control. Urine samples were collected to determine the concentration of Na+, K+ and Cl~ and the blood samples were collected to determine the urine creatinine (Ucr), serum creatinine (Scr) andNa+-K+ATPase. Furthermore, kidney tissues were also collected to test the Na+-K+ ATPase and Carbonic Anhydrase (CA). The results showed that the volume of urine and the concentration of Na+, K+ and Cl~ in the 6 h urine samples were dramatically increased in the rats administered i.g., with water decoction and EAF as compared to the control group. Furthermore, the water decoction of Poria showed inhibitory effects on Na+-K+ ATPase in kidney while EAF showed inhibitory effects on the Na+-K+ ATPase action in both blood and kidney. Therefore, the EAF should be the diuretic fraction of Poria. The underlying diuretic action mechanisms of the EAF might be due to: (1) Increasing the release of Na+ and Cl~ in urine and (2) Inhibiting the Na+-K+ ATPase activity in both blood and kidney. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Diuretic action; Fraction; Poria; Poria cocos (Schw.) wolf","acetic acid ethyl ester; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); alcohol; carbonate dehydratase; chloride ion; creatinine; hydrochlorothiazide; petroleum ether; polysaccharide; Poria cocos extract; potassium ion; sodium ion; water; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood sampling; Chinese medicine; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine clearance; creatinine urine level; diuretic activity; enzyme inhibition; erythrocyte; fractionation; kidney parenchyma; male; nonhuman; Poria cocos; rat; side effect; tissue homogenate; unspecified side effect; urinalysis",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Static non-renewal tests were conducted for 96 h to determine LC50 of the wastewater for both sites using five concentrations (6.25–100 %). Fish were regularly noticed for any deviation in behaviour and external morphology. Physico-chemical analysis of wastewater was done using standard methods recommended by APHA/AWWA/WEF (2005). Chronic toxicity tests were conducted for 15 and 30 days with sublethal concentrations of wastewater (50–90 % of LC50) and gill histopathology was assessed. Wastewater near a paper mill was more toxic as observed from LC50 values of 72.45 %. There was evident deterioration of water quality as the recorded values of some parameters were higher than the standard discharge limits. The test fish exhibited increased air gulping and surfacing, erratic movements initially and decreased opercular movements as the exposure period increased. Morphological observations include increased body colouration, mucus secretion, scale loss and haemorrhages on the skin and lower lip. Alterations in the gill histology such as complete lamellar fusion, epithelial lifting and intraepithelial oedema, haemorrhages, lamellar necrosis and aneurysm were noted in the test fish.

While Co-Digestion of municipal wastewater with Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) is a recognized and well documented process within the waste water industry (Parry, 2013), monitoring of Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) and alkalinity has traditionally been performed by manual grab-sample testing. The result is that FOG is typically carefully added in co-digestion to avoid upsets to the digester (Kabouris et al., 2009). The presented case study illustrates the use of online real-time alkalinity and VFA monitoring to calibrate an adaptive control methodology (Petrella, WEF/IWA, 2015) that is in turn used to optimize a retrofitted municipal digester located in Glenn Rock, New Jersey at the Ridgewood Village Sewer Authority. The retrofit included a FOG receiving and feeding station, combined heat and power unit, gas storage unit, gas conditioning system, and an intertie protection system. The combined heat and power unit is capable of net positive power generation and is limited by a power utility agreement to annualized net zero export. The focus of the presented case study is the use of on-line alkalinity and VFA monitoring equipment that enables integration with a dynamic mathematical model of the co-digestion process to optimally control feedstock feeding schedules to the digester (Wingler et al, 2014). Real-time monitoring enables optimization of loading rates and biogas production. The results of the Alkalinity-VFA measurements are used to update the kinetic coefficients in the model to guarantee good predictive behavior.

Here we briefly review the soil wind erosion research course and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the current soil wind erosion models. From the perspective of the dynamics of wind erosion, we classified the factors affecting soil wind erosion into three categories, namely, wind erosivity factors (WEF), soil antierodibility factors (SAF), and roughness interference factors (RIF). We proposed the concept of a standard plot of soil wind erosion to solve the problem of uncertainty of the soil wind erosion modulus on a spatial scale, and provided methods to set similarity conditions in wind tunnel simulation experiments and to convert the spatial scale of the wind erosion modulus from the standard plot to a large scale field. We also proposed a conceptual model on the basis of the dynamics of soil wind erosion with the theoretical basis that wind produces a shear force on the soil surface. This shear force is partitioned by barely erodible soil surfaces and roughness elements on the ground, and the amount of soil loss by wind should be calculated by comparing the shear force of the wind on barely erodible soil surfaces with the anti-erosion force of the surface soil. One advantage of this conceptual model is that the calculated soil wind erosion modulus is not subject to changes of spatial scale. Finally, we recommended continual improvement of the existing models while also establishing new models. © 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","conceptual dynamic model of soil wind erosion; conversion of soil loss in spatial scales; factors affecting soil wind erosion; standard plot","Dynamic models; Erosion; Wind tunnels; Interference factor; Roughness elements; Soil loss; Soil wind erosion; Standard-plot; Wind erosion equation (WEQ); Wind erosion prediction systems (WEPS); Wind-tunnel simulation; Soils",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Currently, at least 10% of the global population is affected by a mental health disorder, a figure that is set to increase year on year. Meanwhile, the rate of development of new CNS drugs has not increased for many years, despite unprecedented levels of investment. In response to this state of affairs, the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (CINP) convened a summit to discuss ways to reverse this disturbing trend through new partnerships to accelerate CNS drug discovery. The objectives of the Summit were to explore the issues affecting the value chain (i.e. the chain of activities or stakeholders that a company engages in/with to deliver a product to market) in brain research, thereby gaining insights from key stakeholders and developing actions to address unmet needs; to identify achievable objectives to address the issues; to develop action plans to bring about measurable improvements across the value chain and accelerate CNS drug discovery; and fnally, to communicate recommendations to governments, the research and development community, and other relevant stakeholders. Summit outputs include the following action plans, aligned to the pressure points within the brain research-drug development value chain: 1. Code of conduct dealing with conlfict of interest issues, 2. Prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment, 3. Linking science and regulation, 4. Patient involvement in trial design, definition of endpoints, etc., 5. Novel trial design, 6. Reproduction and confirmation of data, 7.

However, despite of huge resource investments, the adoption rate of e-government initiatives over the world is far from expectations. By the year 2014, a large number of UN member states remain in the bottom third of the Online Service Index (OSI). There's still a huge difference in OSI between countries sharing similar national income and telecommunication infrastructure levels. These evidences suggest that apart from technical aspects, non-Technical aspect such as social and organizational factors as well as the heterogeneity between countries such as national culture should be taken into consideration when implementing e-government. Given the challenges discussed above, questions have been raised concerning what determinant might influence to the discriminant in e-service provision among countries. This topic has been of interest to researchers recently. However, most of studies either utilized primary data in which the results was constrained to a specific case study with small samples, or employed secondary data sources which can be criticized for lacking of explanatory power due to omitting important factors. In order to bridging this gap, this paper employs Technology - Organization - Environment (TOE) framework cooperatively with Hofstede's national culture dimensions to provide a comprehensive insight about e-service adoption process. For validating above hypotheses, this study utilizes secondary data from different sources: The culture dimension scores from Hofstede et al. (2010)'s survey; the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s Global Information Technology Report; and the IAC-Waseda E-government Ranking. The result suggests that management optimization process, government IT leadership, ICT legislation framework and national culture have influences to the e-service provision. The implications of this study would help policy makers to realize the strengths and weaknesses of the country's current status of e-government development, thus to provide proper adjustments.","Cross-cultural studies; E-service; Hofstede; National culture; TOE","Economics; Investments; Quality of service; Social sciences; Cross-cultural study; E- services; Global information technology; Hofstede; National cultures; Social and organizational factors; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; Telecommunication infrastructures; Government data processing","","9th European Conference on IS Management and Evaluation, ECIME 2015","21 September 2015 through 22 September 2015",,119232,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

The purpose of the research study is to improve the competitiveness of the electronics manufacturing sector in view of the industrial policies and recently announce (2014) 'Make In India' initiatives by the newly formed government, from its potential of manufacturing, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and policy liberalization perspective. In order to undertake this study a sample survey is done. A sample survey is administered to sample of electronics manufacturing companies, government officials and the academician situated in India to elicit the opinion of professional managers, decision makers and researchers on industrial policies and FDI. Apart from this empirical analysis and five semi-structured interviews are taken for the focused insight on why FDI policy liberalization is essential for electronics manufacturing in view of 'Make in India' initiatives to improve the competitiveness of the industries. The research findings suggest that FDI is positively related to the FDI policy changes, FDI contributes to economic development when the country has substantial absorptive capability for the latest technologies, as India has the largest pool of educated people; those are familiar with needs and want of the latest technologies products. The raising information technology (IT) infrastructure in the country has also created the demand and huge market for the foreign and domestic investors this is also enhanced bye-governance initiatives of taken up by the government. In addition to this, FDI act as vehicle for the transfer of latest technology, thereby contributing economic growth than the domestic investment. Further, there is need for domestic manufacturers to form a collaboration and participate in development process and heads towards a sustainable competitiveness. The research study considers FDI focused strategies, and argues that there is a prominent role for policy intervention under 'Make in India' initiatives.","Competitiveness; Electronics manufacturing; FDI; Industrial policies; Make in India","Automobile manufacture; Cybernetics; Decision making; Economics; Industrial research; Information science; Investments; Manufacture; Public policy; Surveys; Competitiveness; Electronic manufacturing industry; Electronics manufacturing; Electronics manufacturing companies; Foreign direct investments; Industrial policies; Information technology infrastructure; Make in India; Competition","International Institute of Informatics and Systemics (IIIS)","19th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, WMSCI 2015","12 July 2015 through 15 July 2015",,116973,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

However, at non-toxic concentrations, the effects of an aqueous extract of E. fortunei (WEF) on the metastatic and angiogenic potential of malignant tumor cells have not been reported. In this study, we found that WEF suppressed the metastatic properties, including anchorage-independent colony formation, migration, and invasion, by downregulating the proteolytic activity of MMP-9. NF-kB activation and the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK were reduced significantly by WEF. Additionally, WEF inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis markedly, affecting HUVEC migration, tube formation by HUVECs, and microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings via a reduction in VEGF in tumors. In a pulmonary metastasis model, daily administration of WEF at 50 mg/kg markedly decreased metastatic colonies of intravenously injected B16F10 cells on the lung surface in C57BL/6J mice. Further, none of the WEF-administered mice exhibited systemic toxicity.

Materials and methods A selective and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was established to determine the plasma concentrations of the fourteen compounds to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters after orally administration of FF, TLF, FF-WEF, FF-TLF, TLF-WEF and FF-TLF-WEF with approximately the same dose. At different time points, the concentration of rutin (1), isoquercitrin (2), quercetin 3-O-[4-O-(-β-D- glucosyl)-α-L-rhamnoside] (3), ginkgolide C (4), bilobalide (5), quercitrin (6), ginkgolide B (7), ginkgolide A (8), luteolin (9), quercetin (10), apigenin (11), kaempferol (12), isorhamnetin (13), genkwanin (14) in rat plasma were determined and main pharmacokinetic parameters including T 1/2, Tmax, Cmax and AUC were calculated using the DAS 3.2 software package. The statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test with P&lt;0.05 as the level of significance. Results FF and WEF had no effect on the pharmacokinetic behaviors and parameters of the four terpene lactones, but the pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters of flavonoids changed while co-administered with non-flavonoid components. It was found that Cmax and AUC of six flavonoid aglycones in group FF-WEF, FF-TLF and FF-TLF-WEF had varying degrees of reduction in comparison with group FF, especially in group FF-TLF-WEF. On the contrary, the values of Cmax, Tmax and AUC of four flavonoid glycosides in group FF-TLF-WEF were significantly increased compared with those in group FF. Conclusions These results indicate that non-flavonoid components in Ginkgo biloba extracts could increase the absorption and improve the bioavailability of flavonoid glycosides but decrease the absorption and reduce the bioavailability of flavonoid aglycones. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Behaviors such as exploration and social interactions can be best studied by observing unrestrained, freely behaving animals. Weakly electric fish (WEF) display readily observable exploratory and social behaviors by emitting electric organ discharge (EOD). Here, we describe three effective techniques to synchronously measure the EOD, body position, and posture of a free-swimming WEF for an extended period of time. First, we describe the construction of an experimental tank inside of an isolation chamber designed to block external sources of sensory stimuli such as light, sound, and vibration. The aquarium was partitioned to accommodate four test specimens, and automated gates remotely control the animals' access to the central arena. Second, we describe a precise and reliable real-time EOD timing measurement method from freely swimming WEF. Signal distortions caused by the animal's body movements are corrected by spatial averaging and temporal processing stages. Third, we describe an underwater near-infrared imaging setup to observe unperturbed nocturnal animal behaviors. Infrared light pulses were used to synchronize the timing between the video and the physiological signal over a long recording duration. Our automated tracking software measures the animal's body position and posture reliably in an aquatic scene. In combination, these techniques enable long term observation of spontaneous behavior of freely swimming weakly electric fish in a reliable and precise manner. We believe our method can be similarly applied to the study of other aquatic animals by relating their physiological signals with exploratory or social behaviors. © JoVE 2006-2014.

Diagnosis of the frontogenetic forcings on a realistic high-resolution simulation was used to identify the processes involved in the formation and evolution of the equatorial SST-front. The turbulent forcing associated with the mixed-layer turbulent heat flux was found to be systematically frontolytic while the dynamic forcing associated with currents was found to be frontogenetic for the equatorial SST-front. Nevertheless, the low-frequency component of the turbulent forcing was frontogenetic and initiated the SST-front which was then amplified and maintained by the leading dynamic forcing. This forcing was mainly driven by the meridional convergence of the northern South Equatorial Current (nSEC) and the Guinea Current, which points out the essential role played by the circulation in the equatorial SST-front evolution. The quasi-biweekly variability of the equatorial SST-front and its forcings were found to be more strongly coupled to the wind energy flux (WEF) than to the surface wind stress. In fact the WEF controlled the convergence/divergence of the nSEC and Guinea Current and thus the meridional component of the leading dynamic forcing. The WEF explains the equatorial SST-front development better than the wind does because it is a coupled ocean-atmosphere process. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Frontogenesis; Mixed-layer processes; SST-front","energy flux; equatorial dynamics; frontogenesis; heat flux; Lagrangian analysis; sea surface temperature; turbulent flow; wind forcing; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Equatorial); Atlantic Ocean (Tropical)",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Evidence for the actual impact direction and its determinants has however so far been inconclusive. Examining different regulation characteristics and distinguishing between their long-term and short-term effects brings the two seemingly contradictory concepts in line. Based on Executive Opinion Surveys that are annually conducted by the WEF and the IMD, country-level competitiveness effects are evaluated and the determinants are estimated in a panel regression. The estimation results call for a flexible regulation design that allows for different ways of achieving compliance. The fact that regulatory pressure is found to be strongly associated with a more positive perception of long-term impacts lends support to the induced-innovation-hypothesis. While controlling for potential effects from affluence, market size and trade openness, the impact on long-term competitiveness seems also to be affected by environmental quality institutions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, since the 1970s, the GCC has witnessed rapid population growth and economic development, brought on by sharp increases in oil revenues. Population growth coupled with increased urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural output has placed tremendous pressure on the region’s scarce groundwater resources. GCC countries are all using hundreds to thousands times more water than sustainable recharge would allow. Their water footprints, among the highest in the world, are sustained by unconventional sources of water such as desalination, wastewater reuse, and the import of “virtual” water via agricultural goods. This paper analyzes the current state of water in the GCC using a water–energy–food (WEF) nexus approach.

Concerns have been raised about how global warming would accelerate future climate change and its consequences. Many climate change studies expect the possible occurrence of extreme high temperature, increase in heavy rains and strong typhoons in the near future. Currently, climate change scenarios are used to prepare an appropriate plan for these phenomena under climate change. The main purpose of this paper is to suggest and evaluate an operational method of assessing the potential impact of climate change on hydrologic components and water resources at the regional scale. Future runoff was simulated using high resolution Regional Circulation Model (RCM) (12.5 x 12.5 km) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and a semi-distribution model or SLURP (Semi-distributed Land Use-based Runoff Process). The study was carried out on the Han River including its nine dams. The study found that runoff characteristics, especially annual distribution, could change. The discharge in July tends to decrease while runoff can increase in August and September. The flow duration curve was estimated and compared with observed data and simulated daily runoff data for Paldang-dam to evaluate the effect of climate change. The analysis of the flow duration curve shows that the mean average low flow increased while the average wet and normal flow decreased under the climate change scenario. © 2014, Chinese Geoscience Union.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative interpretive hermeneutic approach is used to analyse a variety of publically published secondary sources on the CSR of Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Co-operative in the UK grocery multiple sector (2005-2010). Findings - CSR strategic outcomes currently favour the firm more than society interests. A multilayered framework in the form of Social Responsibility of the Corporation (SRC) is designed and offered in support of balancing the business-society relationship more evenly. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to firms originating from within the UK grocery multiple sector. Asda could not be included in the study as it does not publish CSR reports annually in the UK after becoming part of Walmart group. Practical implications - A framework for multi-level standardised definition of CSR in the form of SRC is offered. The inclusion of employees and members of the public on CSR/SRC boards is recommended to foster wider collaboration. The SRC framework promotes standardisation at global level while respecting diversity and firm heterogeneity at firm level. The findings may further contribute to GRI; UN Global Compact; WEF dialogues. Social implications - Recommendations are made to extend CSR board diversity for improved dialogue with communities. The SRC framework may be applied at global; national; industry and firm level. The framework can be applied internationally or locally. Future studies may offer quantitative attributes for balancing CSR/SRC. Originality/value - A globally unique and universally applicable framework for evaluating CSR activities is proposed. Future studies may extend the authors' framework to other industries, national environments or globally in the pursuit of balance between firm and society. Furthermore, firms may also adopt the framework to support CSR activities. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This quote from the 2011 WEF Renewable Energy Position Statement clearly calls attention to the role of wastewater management through Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRF) to address the needs of the Utility of the Future. The water resources utility of the future will integrate these three major concepts of Nutrients, Energy and Water, and many cutting edge utilities are already implementing this management goal of resource recovery. This focus may initially have been internal to the water or wastewater utility, investigating sustainable energy management through energy conservation, increased renewable energy production (where feasible), and focus on overall energy management. The overall societal benefit of the resilience improvement through distributed generation is starting to be realized. The fact that a water resource recovery facility (wastewater plant) that generates its own energy can operate when the power is out is an asset during extreme events. In addition, this capacity can be coordinated with electric utilities to address peak loads and other system needs. Valuable energy products generated on-site at wastewater plants can also supply a portion of energy demand within their respective service areas. On average, the energy content of wastewater (chemical, hydraulic and thermal) is five times greater than the energy required for treatment. The most common opportunity for on-site power generation is through biogas created through anaerobic digestion. However, technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis, and incineration may be used to generate electricity or fuel. District energy systems, facilities to generate renewable diesel or aviation fuel, hydrogen fuel cells, and in-line hydropower are all being installed today. However, becoming net energy positive is not the only goal. Optimizing overall sustainability may actually require using more energy or producing less energy onsite. Treating water to higher standards is often more energy intensive. Similarly, using biogas as a transportation fuel reduces onsite power production and increased energy use is required to further process biosolids to maximize reuse potential and to recover nutrients and minerals (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium). A number of utilities worldwide have already taken the leap and begun this transformation towards resource recovery. While it is not practical for all water resource recovery facilities to become energy positive or neutral, all can take steps towards increasing sustainability while also improving resilience in the energy sector.

The authors present here the first operational system able to monitor in near-real time daily emission estimates, using a mesoscale atmospheric inversion framework over the city of Davos, Switzerland, before, during, and after the World Economic Forum 2012 Meeting (WEF-2012). Two instruments that continuously measured atmospheric mixing ratios of greenhouse gases (GHGs) were deployed at two locations from 23 December 2011 to 3 March 2012: one site was located in the urban area and the other was out of the valley in the surrounding mountains. Carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide were measured continuously at both sites. The Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale atmospheric model (WRF), in four-dimensional data assimilation mode, was used to simulate the transport of GHGs over the valley of Davos at 1.3-km resolution. Wintertime emissions prior to the WEF-2012 were about 40% higher than the initial annual inventory estimate, corresponding to the use of heating fuel in the winter. Daily inverse fluxes were highly correlated with the local climate, especially during the severe cold wave that affected most of Europe in early February 2012. During the WEF-2012, emissions dropped by 35% relative to the first month of the deployment, despite similar temperatures and the presence of several thousand participants at the meeting. On the basis of composite diurnal cycles of hourly CO/CO2 ratios, the absence of traffic peaks during the WEF-2012 meeting indicated that change in road emissions is potentially responsible for the observed decrease in the city emissions during the meeting. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Carbon cycle; Data assimilation; Greenhouse gases; Inverse methods; Mesoscale models","Atmosphere-land interactions; Carbon cycles; Data assimilation; Inverse methods; Meso-scale models; Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Inverse problems; Landforms; Methane; Weather forecasting; Greenhouse gases; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; data assimilation; emission inventory; environmental monitoring; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; inverse analysis; mesoscale meteorology; methane; mixing ratio; urban atmosphere; Davos; Graubunden; Switzerland",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus

The study aims to correct the following flaws in the WEF: the difference between assessment and reality resulting from the fluidity of water resources; the lack of management and planning as a part of the dynamic tendency in the traditional water resource ecological footprint (WEF). The multi-scale EPI comprises the ratio of the WEF to water resource ecological carrying capacity (WECC) after comparing the traditional ecological footprint and the water footprint for correcting the former fault. Results show that the gap between the assessment and reality is more obvious from upstream to downstream. Such gap is demonstrated through the large differences in the EPI values of Panjin in 2002, with 13.87 in the city scale, 1.82 in the watershed scale involving the fluidity of the water resource among the cites, and 1.70 in the basin scale. The mean EPI values of the Liao-Hun and Taizi Watersheds are 1.36 and 1.17, respectively, indicating the imbalance of water resource supply and consumption between the watersheds. By forecasting the population, we determined that the time series prediction of EPI in the basin for the second flaws will exceed 1.33 in 2025, indicating that the water resource sustainability may be insufficient in the future. The proposed multi-scale assessment of WEF aims to evaluate the complex relationship between water resource supply and consumption in different spatial scales and time series.

The signal source location can be estimated using multiple detectors and the inverse relationship between the received signal intensity (RSI) and the distance, but difficulty of the source localization increases if there is an additional dependence on the orientation of a signal source. In such cases, the signal source could be approximated as an ideal dipole for simplification. Based on a theoretical model, the RSI can be directly predicted from a known dipole location; but estimating a dipole location from RSIs has no direct analytical solution. Here, we propose an efficient solution to the dipole localization problem by using a lookup table (LUT) to store RSIs predicted by our theoretically derived dipole model at many possible dipole positions and orientations. For a given set of RSIs measured at multiple detectors, our algorithm found a dipole location having the closest matching normalized RSIs from the LUT, and further refined the location at higher resolution. Studying the natural behavior of weakly electric fish (WEF) requires efficiently computing their location and the temporal pattern of their electric signals over extended periods. Our dipole localization method was successfully applied to track single or multiple freely swimming WEF in shallow water in real-time, as each fish could be closely approximated by an ideal current dipole in two dimensions. Our optimized search algorithm found the animal's positions, orientations, and tail-bending angles quickly and accurately under various conditions, without the need for calibrating individual-specific parameters. Our dipole localization method is directly applicable to studying the role of active sensing during spatial navigation, or social interactions between multiple WEF. Furthermore, our method could be extended to other application areas involving dipole source localization. © 2013 Jun et al.",,"algorithm; animal experiment; article; calibration; controlled study; dipole; electric fish; eye tracking; nonhuman; orientation; predator prey interaction; signal detection; social interaction; swimming; theoretical model; animal; animal behavior; biological model; Gymnotiformes; physiology; swimming; Animalia; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Gymnotiformes; Models, Biological; Swimming",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

The paper critically investigates the work of the WEF in this area, suggesting that WEF-produced gender and development discourse is profoundly compatible with the politics and practices of neoliberalism-not least in the way in which it aligns gender equality and women's empowerment with national economic competitiveness. This is, furthermore, a distinctly postfeminist reading of gender that rests upon the production of neoliberal-compatible female subjectivities-such as ""rational economic woman"" or ""Davos woman""-who emerge as those in society best able to deliver fair and sustainable economic growth (effectively rescuing global capitalism from the excesses of hypermasculine crisis capitalism). The framing of the case for gender equality and women's empowerment in these terms is powerful and may well be an effective way for gender advocates to present their demands. But by analyzing not only how the WEF has framed/represented gender issues but also what has been left out of this representation, the paper points to the way in which simplistic representations concerning the contribution that women make to economic competitiveness disguise the double burdens and gendered structures of socioeconomic inequality that are central to the widening and deepening of the market into all spheres of social life under conditions of roll-back neoliberalism. © 2013 International Studies Association.",,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The objective of this study is to provide an alternative and non-invasive means of tracking WEF in real-time using neural networks (NN). This study was carried out in three stages. First stage was to recreate voltage distributions by simulating the WEF using EIDORS and finite element method (FEM) modelling. Second stage was to validate the model using phantom data acquired from an Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) based system, including a phantom fish and tank. In the third stage, the measurement data was acquired using a restrained WEF within a tank. We trained the NN based on the voltage distributions for different locations of the WEF. With networks trained on the acquired data, we tracked new locations of the WEF and observed the movement patterns. The results showed a strong correlation between expected and calculated values of WEF position in one dimension, yielding a high spatial resolution within 1 cm and 10 times higher temporal resolution than IR cameras.

This roadmap leverages a framework developed by the electric power sector. Known as the The Smart Grid Maturity Model (SGMM), the framework moved the industry toward ""Smart Grid"" technology. The basis of the Energy Roadmap originated at a workshop of water and power industry leaders convened by WEF in North Carolina in March 2012. Case studies were analyzed from successful utilities in Austria, Holland, Australia, and the United States. High level, strategic best practices were identified and organized into topic areas, which define the level of progression (enable, integrate and optimize) towards achieving energy sustainability. As a living document, the roadmap is always under review by dedicated groups within the industry. A number of utilities worldwide have already taken the leap and begun this transformation towards resource recovery and many more are peering over the edge. The WEF Energy Roadmap is intended to guide utilities of all sizes as they progress toward becoming treatment plants of the future. While it is not practical for all wastewater treatment plants to become energy positive or neutral, all can take steps towards increasing energy sustainability. A key component of the WEF Energy Roadmap is collaboration between water/wastewater utilities and electric utilities.

Municipal utilities need to provide significant improvements on how they manage wet weather related flows in their wastewater collection system as the result of increased regulatory requirements, public pressures, and aging infrastructure. Wet weather flows in combined sewer systems or separate systems, in many cases, exceed the original sewer hydraulic design capacity.

This guide presented an approach to decision-making based on risk management principles. The impacts of sewer overflows were identified in the context of risks to community values (such as preserving public health, protecting property, achieving regulatory compliance, etc.). Specific performance measures allowed the quantification of risk reduction measures, allowing the development of a benefit/cost evaluation that considers and compares on an equal basis a broad range of community interests. MSD implemented this approach in five phases across four parallel paths, working concurrently with the technical team, the Stakeholder Group, the federal and state regulators and the general public.

Phase 4 performed the level of control analysis and developed implementation priorities. Phase 5 implemented the program. MSD successfully utilized this approach to produce an approvable plan, which met the community objectives at a reasonable cost. Regulatory approval for the IOAP was received within 9 months of submission. The price tag for the Final IOAP was estimated at $850 million, and will be implemented over a 19 year period that ends December 2024. This cost compares to an estimated $1.9 billion had MSD simply accepted a zero overflow level of protection for CSOs, and a 10 percent probability storm for elimination of SSOs. This paper will discuss MSD’s approach, including the five project phases implemented across the four parallel paths. Copyright © 2013 Water Environment Federation.

It is intended to allow communities to balance CWA requirements and address most pressing public health and environmental projection first. It is a voluntary process and the community is responsible for developing the integrated plan. The IPF encourages the use of innovative technologies, including green and sustainable options. An integrated plan can be incorporated into a compliance or enforcement action, with enforceable actions and schedules.

As in all composite applications, the component services are composed and configured to meet requirements for the composite application. However, in a field experiment of composite service-oriented applications wef found that, although the services as actually delivered by the service providers meet their requirements, there is still a mismatch across service providers due to unstated assumptions, and that this mismatch causes an incorrect composite application to be delivered to end-users. Identifying and analyzing these initially unstated assumptions turns requirements engineering for service-oriented applications into risk analysis. In this paper, we describe a field experiment with an experimental service-oriented homecare system, in which unexpected behavior of the system turned up unstated assumptions about the contributing service providers. We then present an assumptions-driven risk identification method that can help identifying these risks, and we show how we applied this method in the second iteration of the field experiment. The method adapts some techniques from problem frame diagrams to identify relevant assumptions on service providers. The method is informal, and takes the 'view from nowhere' in that it does not result in a specification of the component services, but for every component service delivers a set of assumptions that the service must satisfy in order to contribute to the overall system requirements.

Many climate change studies expect the possible occurrence of extreme high temperature and increase in heavy rains and strong typhoons in the near future. Currently, climate change scenarios are used to prepare an appropriate plan for these phenomena under climate change. The main purpose of this paper is to suggest and evaluate an operational method of assessing the potential impact of climate change on hydrologic components and water resources at the regional scale. Future runoff was simulated using high resolution RCM (12.5 km X 12.5 km) RCP scenario operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and a semi-distribution model or SLURP. The study was carried out on the Han River including its nine dams. The study found that runoff characteristics, especially annual distribution, could change. The discharge in July tends to decrease while runoff can increase in August and September. The flow duration curve was estimated and compared with observed data and simulated daily runoff data for Paldang-dam to evaluate the effect of climate change. The analysis of the flow duration curve shows that the mean average low flow increased while the average wet and normal flow decreased under the climate change scenario. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Global warming; Annual distributions; Climate change scenarios; Flow duration curve; Hydrologic components; Impact assessments; Operational methods; Runoff characteristics; Semi distributions; Runoff","(EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers;Environmental and Water Resources Institute","World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2013: Showcasing the Future","19 May 2013 through 23 May 2013","Cincinnati, OH",100671,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

The wavelet energy (WE) is a new and robust parameter, and is derived using wavelet transform. It can reduce the influences of different types of noise at different levels. WEF can reflect the WE distribution of characters in several directions at different scales. To a non oscillating pattern, the amplitudes of wavelet coefficients increase when the scale of wavelet decomposition increase. WE of different decomposition levels have different powers to discriminate the character images. These features constitute patterns of handwritten characters for classification. The traditional learning algorithms of the different classifiers are far slower than required.

This algorithm learns much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feed forward neural networks.

In late March 2012, WEF held its annual Residuals and Biosolids conference in Raleigh. Two of the three pre-conference workshops were about producing and marketing energy and fertilizer products from biosolids. A keynote at the WEE conference was given by Jan Oleszkiewic of the University of Manitoba.

An empirical analysis based on the latest Report (2009-2010) is carried out. The results show that ""business usage,"" ""business readiness,"" and ""market environment"" are the three root drivers - critical pillars to manipulate the NRI overall scores; whereas ""government readiness,"" which is further mostly affected by the ""government usage,"" is the foremost enabler to the NRI overall scores.

Over the last three years, the American Water Works Association (AWWA), the Water Environment Federation (WEF), and the WateReuse Association (WRA) have been working with the two plumbing code organizations [International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) and International Code Council (ICC)] to change their 2009 plumbing code requirement. The 2009 code stipulates purple pipe use for any alternate waters and green pipe for potable water. Alternate waters are any non-traditional source of water to offset potable water use, including onsite treated wastewater, greywater, and rainwater. AWWA, WEF, and WRA presented a white paper in August 2009 to IAPMO proposing revisions that would distinguish between reclaimed water and other alternative water sources. These suggestions, along with comments of other organization and individuals have been rejected as not meeting code change criteria.

In recent years, teams of students in the Environmental Engineering capstone senior design course at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) have participated in three different design competitions: the regional design competition organized by the local Water Environment Federation (WEF) chapter, the AECOM North American design competition, and an intra-collegiate competition sponsored by Halliburton. These competitions have been optional projects among service-learning projects for local and international communities and projects for local industries. This research compared the student preferences for different project types and the learning outcomes from the different projects. Matching the students' declared specialization within the environmental engineering degree program with a project helped improve student motivation, which is a challenge given the six different concentrations available to students at CU in water, air, ecology, remediation, chemical processing, and energy. Initially, students were not interested in participating in the design competitions. More recently the idea seems to have caught on, perhaps motivated in part by two teams winning their competition at the national level. However, student interest is still higher in service-projects. Similar learning outcomes could be achieved in both service-learning and design competition projects.

The geometric mean diameter (GMD) was also lower and wind erodible fraction (WEF) was greater for the amended treatments than unamended control. We attributed this manure effect to increased organic matter content in the soil making the aggregates more friable and susceptible to breakdown by tillage. Carbon, N, and P concentrations were not shifted to smaller aggregate sizes where root growth and nutrient uptake are generally greater. The exception was mineralizable N, which tended to be greater in the finer &lt; 0.47 mm fraction. Mineralizable soil N in all aggregate sizes≥0.47 mm was reduced for wood-chip compared with straw bedding, and resulted in net N immobilization in aggregate sizes ≥ 1.2 mm. Phosphorus sorption was lower in soil amended with wood-chips compared with straw bedding for aggregates ≥ 0.47 mm. Long-term manure application may shift soil aggregates from larger to finer fractions because of greater friability and suggests that these soils should be managed to avoid the greater risk of wind erosion.","Aggregate size distribution; Aggregates; Dry-sieving; Geometric mean diameter; Nitrogen; Wind erodible fraction","cattle; diameter; immobilization; long-term change; manure; nutrient uptake; size distribution; soil aggregate; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; wind erosion; Bos",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

JEA, a municipally owned utility located in Jacksonville, Florida has experienced challenges that other similar utilities have faced including a collection system with a history of underinvestment and a regulatory mandate to reduce SSOs. Recent water conservation initiatives coupled with a decline in the economy due to the extended recession have resulted in declining revenues. This has put pressure on utilities to hold the line on budgets needed to fund the operation, maintenance and capital costs to address the growing collection system demands. With little room for increases in the operation, maintenance and capital budgets, JEA has taken a different approach to improving the operation and maintenance of its wastewater collection system while continuing to reduce SSOs. This approach is built on a framework of an asset management system that has become the global standard for asset management for energy and water utilities. JEA adopted the British utility asset management standard which is Publically Available Standard PAS 55. JEA's SSO reduction strategy started with the selection of a formal SSO management program. EPA's Capacity, Management, Operation and Maintenance (CMOM) Assessment was selected as a basis for comparing JEA's SSO Reduction Program to current industry best practices. JEA also utilized the Core Attributes of Effectively Managed Wastewater Collection Systems (APWA, ASCE, NACWA, WEF, 2010) and the Water Environment Research Foundation Strategic Asset Management Gap tools. JEA implemented a comprehensive condition assessment program and established an enterprise data management system. Data is leveraged through a rigorous approach using root cause and statistical analysis. JEA incorporates the Six Sigma methodology which has helped change the culture at JEA to one driven by factual analysis. Risk rankings are captured using criticality matrices to prioritize both condition assessments and countermeasures. JEA also employed the latest technologies in both the condition assessment and control of the wastewater collection system operations. An example of the latest technology is the deployment of the next generation Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA). JEA has been able to reduce staffing and improve control and troubleshooting of the wastewater collection system by using real time data. JEA uses statistical analysis of data from SCADA system, the computerized work management system (CMMS), and the geographic information system (GIS) to create risk prioritizations that drive condition assessment inspections and ranking of wastewater pumping stations, manholes, wastewater force mains, and the large diameter trunk sewers. JEA also uses run time data from pumping station SCADA to prioritize smoke testing and closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection of the gravity collection system to identify areas that are the largest contributors to inflow and infiltration (I/I). An innovative fats, oils and greases (FOG) regulatory program leverages the resources of the contractor community (grease haulers) and has been extremely effective in reducing the cost of cleaning due to commercially generated grease, resulting in the reduction of the number of associated SSOs. JEA has concluded that through the implementation of a rigorous asset management program coupled with industry best practices, that it is possible to significantly reduce the number and severity of SSOs without large capital and operation and maintenance budget increases. It should be noted that when a utility switches from a culture of reactive maintenance to one of predictive and preventative maintenance there will be initial increases in costs. However, within a fairly short period of time (approximately five years) costs can be reduced to levels near or below what was previously budgeted with the added benefit that capital and O&M costs are being directed towards actions that will have the greatest impact on the effort to reduce SSOs. © 2012 Water Environment Federation.",,"Asset management; Budget control; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Economics; Maintenance; Oils and fats; Process engineering; Pumping plants; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Sanitary sewers; SCADA systems; Smoke; Statistical methods; Water conservation; Condition assessment program; Enterprise data management systems; Municipally owned utilities; Strategic asset managements; Supervisory control and dataacquisition systems (SCADA); Wastewater collection systems; Wastewater pumping station; Water environment research foundations; Information management",,"85th Annual Water Environment Federation Technical Exhibition and Conference, WEFTEC 2012","29 September 2012 through 3 October 2012",,149504,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

It posits that there are a number of country-level determinants for the SARS and these determinants are grouped into four main categories: legal framework, corporate governance, market and higher education. This study aims to expand the domain of auditing and reporting by using country-level data than is usually found in the auditing literature. Design/methodology/approach: Data were accessed from the World Economic Forum (WEF) Report (2009), World Bank Reports on Observation of Standards and Codes (ROSC) and the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The ROSC was used to synthesise the status of auditing in the 41 countries, whereas the IFAC report was used to determine the adoption of international standards on auditing. Data on SARS and its determinants were gathered from the WEF Report to empirically examine the validity of the hypotheses. The ranks of SARS were regressed on the ranks of its determinants. Findings: This paper provides additional empirical evidence on SARS in Europe. It suggests that, in addition to extant literature, judicial independence and efficiency of the legal framework, ethical behaviour of firms, efficacy of corporate boards, strengths of the stock market and extent of staff training in the European countries impact on its SARS. Research limitations/implications: Because the ROSC are not available for all the European countries, this study could not comment on the status of auditing for all the 41 countries. Second, had the countries been grouped into developed, emerging and developing, the determinants of SARS could be different. Practical implications: This paper emphasises the importance of the efficiency of legal framework, corporate governance and the training of staff to maintain a reasonable SARS. Originality/value: This study fills the research gap regarding the absence of an empirical cross-country study on the determinants of the SARS in Europe. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Europe; Financial reporting; IFAC; International Standards on Auditing",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Based upon the compliance approach, a closed-form solution is obtained for SERR versus delamination length, applied load, effective mechanical properties, and geometrical dimensions of DCB specimen. The required effective flexural modulus in this model is determined with three different methodologies, plane stress resultant method, plies arrangement method, and using longitudinal tensile and compressive moduli method. The proposed model is assessed by experimental and numerical results available in the literature for various lay-ups. A comprehensive evaluation is also carried out among various theories which are used to model mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness. Results show that the developed model predicts GI at the onset of delamination growth very well for unidirectional and multidirectional DCB specimens. However, the main advantages of this model are: 1) It gives a simple and accurate explicit closed-form solution for SERR of symmetric unidirectional and multidirectional lay-ups in comparison with the high-order shear deformation beam theories with a very lengthy and tedious procedure. 2) It models both first-order transverse shear deformation and local effects at the crack tip (root rotation) to improve the split beam solution. 3) By simplifying the Timoshenko beam on two-parametric foundation, as a generalized case, special cases like Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams on the Winkler elastic foundation (WEF) are obtainable. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.","DCB specimen; Delamination; Elastic foundation; Strain energy release rate; Timoshenko beam","Applied loads; Beam theories; Closed form solutions; Compliance approach; Comprehensive evaluation; Compressive moduli; DCB specimen; Delamination growth; Delamination length; Developed model; Double cantilever beam; Effective mechanical properties; Elastic foundation; Euler-Bernoulli; First-order; Flexural modulus; Geometrical dimensions; High-order; Interlaminar fracture toughness; Local effects; Longitudinal tensile; Multi-directional; Numerical results; Pasternak; Plane stress; Root rotation; Timoshenko beams; Transverse shear deformation; Winkler elastic foundation; Crack tips; Cracks; Delamination; Energy release rate; Foundations; Fracture toughness; Mechanical properties; Nanocantilevers; Particle beams; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Steel sheet; Strain energy; Strain rate; Cantilever beams",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

In the study six populations, namely Chilimo, Goba, Menagesha-Suba, Wef-Washa, Yabelo and Ziquala were included. A total of 20-24 trees from each population were investigated based on 128 AFLP band positions. AMOVA revealed that most of the variation (94%) resided within populations of J. procera suggesting extensive gene flow among populations which is attributable to the outcrossing mating system and effective gene transport mechanisms of the species.

A compliance based approach is used to calculate critical strain energy release rate (SERR). Two well-known beam theories, i.e. Euler-Bernoulli (EB) and Timoshenko beams (TB), on Winkler and Pasternak elastic foundations (WEF and PEF) are considered. In each case, a closed-form solution is presented for compliance versus crack length, effective material properties and geometrical dimensions. Effective flexural modulus (Efx) and out-of-plane extensional stiffness (E z) are used in all models instead of transversely isotropic assumption in composite laminates. Eventually, the analytical solutions are compared with experimental results available in the literature for unidirectional ([0°]6) and antisymmetric angle-ply ([±30°]5, and [±45°]5) lay-ups. TB on WEF is a simple model that predicts more accurate results for compliance and SERR in unidirectional laminates in comparison to other models. TB on PEF, in accordance with Williams (1989) assumptions, is too stiff for unidirectional DCB specimens, whereas in angle-ply DCB specimens it gives more reliable results.

The rankings are then compared and assessed to determine if the observed difference in the rankings are statistically significant. Findings – A comparison of the ranking of countries on the basis of the value of each index reveals that countries do undergo a change in their competitiveness rank when endogenous weights are used. The results suggest the WEF’s competitiveness index, which uses the same fixed weights applied to every country (or group of countries), creates a bias that favors countries that score high on the“technology” sub-dimension of the index. Practical implications – The study presents an alternative to the current practice of using a fixed set of weights applied uniformly to the basic unit of analysis. The method serves as a starting-point for further research on the biases created by different weighting schemes to construct a composite indicator that aggregates primitive data, with the resulting composite index values then used to rank entities. Originality/value – The method to determine endogenously the weights to be applied to each unit ofanalysis when constructing a composite indicator is novel and has wide applicability to the general issue of comparing performance across different units of analysis based on a composite index of performance (i.e. benchmarking). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Benchmarking; Competitive strategy; International standards; National economy; World economy",,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Design/methodology/approach – The two groups of nations, G7 and BEM, are compared on the basis of various longitudinal and cross-sectional variables. The longitudinal variables are GDP and real GDP growth, per capita GDP, international trade, foreign direct investment, index of ageing, and life expectancy at birth. Cross-sectional competitive indices are Global competitiveness index, index of economic freedom, Democracy index, Human development index, Gini index, Government effectiveness, and Corruption perception index. Findings – The findings show that BEM is growing faster than G7 in most economic indicators including GDP, trade, and investment. The growth results in some form of convergence. The freedom and governance infrastructure of the BEM is relatively weak to support their economic growth. The primary challenge of the BEM is coming from the economic interdependence they create in a globalized economy. Overall, the growth presents a new political reality that the world must recognize. Research limitations/implications – National competitiveness is a long-term issue. A 30-year longitudinal analysis may not be long enough to accurately reflect a nation’s performance. Evidently, wealth creation in the emerging markets has profound influence in noneconomic areas. Political polarization and military confrontation are not unlikely. Practical implications – Governments and businesses in G7, BEM, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) nations and institutions involved in global governance (e.g. World Bank, IMF, and WEF) may use the findings of the study to determine their policies. We should pay special attention to the global economic interdependence and guard against the negative effects of emerging markets’ growth. Originality/value – The comparative analysis between the G7 and BEM in terms of competitiveness and convergence is an original contribution. Also, the author’s insight beyond economics is a unique section to follow.

In late June 2008, water reuse professionals were alerted to a proposed plumbing code that would require use of purple pipe for all graywater systems. The proposal was embedded in updates to the 2009 Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) under final development by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO). Following a round of e-mail alerts to utility members of Water Environment Association (WEF), American Water Works Association (AWWA), and WateReuse Association (WRA), it was apparent that water utility members and reuse professionals were not aware of this proposed change. Industry concerns expressed included: • Concern for potential cross connections between two purple pipe systems with significantly different quality; • Concern that the public could be exposed to inadequately treated water in a municipal purple pipe system contaminated by an onsite cross connection; • Concern that lower-quality onsite water could contaminate a higher-quality onsite water system; and • Concern that public exposure and cross connections would negatively impact public confidence in the municipal reclaimed water system. Based on this reaction, a joint letter to IAPMO was signed by Executive Directors of AWWA, WEF, and WRA on September 24, 2008, stating opposition to the choice of purple pipe for onsite pipe transporting wastewater. Discussion with IAPMO staff identified that the issue included not only on-site graywater systems but all alternate water to include rainwater harvested water, stormwater, and air conditioning condensate. This information broadened the scope of utility member concerns and recognition that other entities unfamiliar with reclaimed water production might influence its use, distribution, and quality. The IAPMO Standards Council rejected the appeal to their Code from these organizations and a formal appeal by Florida Department of Health. Based on the reclaimed community response, IAPMO formed a Green Technical Committee Task Group to review the proposed code requirements and to develop alternative code requirements acceptable to plumbing code inspectors and municipal utility providers. WRA, WEF, and AWWA are supporting technical solutions for consideration by both reclaimed water utility interests and plumbing code enforcement officials. Public health protection and cross connection control are of key interest to all participants. However, AWWA, WEF and WRA are concerned with negative impacts from cross connection of up to four on-site untreated wastewater sources with highly treated municipal reclaimed water. This paper will identify: • Status of interaction with IAPMO; • Differences in potential water quality from multiple sources; • Details of current piping and plumbing code revision actions that have been identified; • Evolution of potential solutions; and, • Process to achieve a mutually agreeable solution. Unfortunately, no change to the Uniform Plumbing Code will be issued until 2012, so there is a lot of discussion on how to define the liquid in your purple pipe. © 2010 American Water Works Association.",,"Air conditioning condensate; American Water Works associations; Code enforcement; Code requirements; Community response; Connection control; Department of healths; Exposed to; Florida; Graywater; Health impact; International Association; Multiple source; Municipal reclaimed waters; Municipal utility; Pipe system; Potential solutions; Public exposure; Public health protection; Re-claimed water; Stormwaters; Task groups; Technical committees; Technical solutions; Untreated wastewater; Utility industry; Water environments; Water reuse; Water source; Water system; Water utility; WateReuse; Cross connections (water distribution); Plumbing; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Waterworks; Water conservation","Water Research Foundation;WateReuse Association;International Desalination Association;Sandia National Laboratories","AWWA Sustainable Water Management Conference and Exposition 2010","11 April 2010 through 14 April 2010","Albuquerque, NM",95750,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Self-cleansing sewers are desirable because they are expected to better maintain design function and extend service life. A key element of the tractive force method is selection of an appropriate design minimum flow rate. The magnitude of the design minimum flow rate should be sufficient to mobilize and drag a design sediment particle along the sewer invert. The problem of estimating the design minimum flow rate can be investigated using basic principles from the Poisson Rectangular Pulse (PRP) model for residential water demands. According to the PRP hypothesis, residential water use follows a diurnal Poisson arrival process with a time dependent rate parameter. When a water use occurs, it is approximated as a rectangular pulse of random intensity and random duration. This simple premise provides a rich robust picture of residential water use. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how theoretical results from the PRP model for residential water use lead to reliability-based estimates of the design minimum flow rate needed in the tractive force approach for sizing self-cleansing sanitary sewers. Results from the PRP estimates will be compared against conventional methods. © 2010 ASCE.","Construction; Design; Sanitary sewers","Basic principles; Construction design; Conventional methods; Design and construction; Design flows; Design functions; Key elements; Minimum flow; Poisson arrival process; Poisson rectangular pulse models; Rate parameters; Rectangular pulse; Residential water demand; Sediment particles; Theoretical result; Time dependent; Tractive force; Water use; Biochemical oxygen demand; Confined flow; Design; Multiobjective optimization; Sanitary sewers; Water supply; Water resources","Environmental and Water Resources Institute of ASCE","World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010: Challenges of Change","16 May 2010 through 20 May 2010","Providence, RI",81213,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Several countries in all regions of the world have established policies and institutions devoted to economic competitiveness, including in developing and transition countries. This leads to the question of how to define national economic competitiveness and, as a logical consequence, how to measure it. This article provides a critical analysis of two major global indices measuring national economic competitiveness, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), with a special focus on the index published by the WEF due to its broader global coverage. The article shows that human capital has been given relatively little explicit recognition, despite the large weight of human capital in the WEF index. This article asserts through simulations based on WEF data that countries performing poorly in national economic competitiveness rankings can improve their standings significantly by focusing reform efforts on raising quality of education and on expanding access to education and training. The simulations also show that the potential improvements in national economic competitiveness are unequally distributed across the globe, and that in terms of national economic competitiveness, developing and transition countries stand to gain relatively most from improving their education and training systems compared to developed nations. Suggestions for improving measurements of education and training in the WEF index conclude the article and it is shown that educationalists can help refocus policy discussions on how to improve education and training systems through discussions on substance. © 2010 The Authors.

We begin by summarizing the literature that convincingly argues that bribery is an immoral and unethical practice and that the economic harm it causes falls most heavily on those least able to absorb it. The next section summarizes the main provisions of anti-bribery legislation including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the Organization for Economic Development's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the laws of selected countries.

The next section focuses on the roles played by NGOs including Transparency International (TI), the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the International Chamber of Commerce. We review trends in enforcement and prosecution, including a review of the United States' enforcement processes, mechanisms for cross-border legal assistance, a discussion of the distinctive nature of FCPA cases, and an assessment of what the future holds for enforcement. The final section focuses on compliance processes for corporations aimed at reducing the risk of FCPA and related violations.

TF design is a major improvement over traditional methods to achieve self-cleansing in gravity sewers. This approach results in a self-cleansing pipe slope value (Smin) for the design minimum flowrate (Qmin) in each sewer reach. Qmin is the predicted largest 1-h flowrate in the reach during the lowest flow week over the sewer design life. Past design practices seldom included accurate estimation of Qmin values, but good estimates of Qmin are crucial for TF design. Design equations and plots have been developed to assist in obtaining Smin values for given Qmin values. As compared to traditional minimum slopes, Smin slopes via the TF method are flatter for sewers carrying typical to larger Qmin values and steeper for sewers carrying smaller Qmin values. © 2009 ASCE.","Design; Sanitary sewers; Sewers","Accurate estimation; Design equation; Design practice; Gravity sewer; Sewer design; Tractive force; Combined sewers; Sanitary sewers; Design; cleanup; flow velocity; sanitation; sewer network; waste technology",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Biometer flask systems and soil microcosm systems contaminated with 2,000 mg of phenanthrene per kg of dry soil and different Cr(VI) concentrations were investigated. Temperature, soil moisture and oxygen availability were controlled to support bioremediation. Cr(VI) inhibited the phenanthrene mineralization (CO2 production) and cultivable PAH degrading bacteria at levels of 500-2,600 mg kg-1. In the bioremediation experiments in soil microcosms the degradation of phenanthrene, the dehydrogenase activity and the increase in PAH degrading bacteria counts were retarded by the presence of Cr(VI) at all studied concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1). These negative effects did not show a correlation with Cr(VI) concentration. Whereas the presence of Cr(VI) had a negative effect on the phenanthrene elimination rate, co-contamination with phenanthrene reduced the residual Cr(VI) concentration in the water exchangeable Cr(VI) fraction (WEF) in comparison with the soil microcosm contaminated only with Cr(VI). Clear differences were found between the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns of each soil microcosm, showing that the presence of different Cr(VI) concentrations did modulate the community response to phenanthrene and caused perdurable changes in the structure of the microbial soil community. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bioremediation; Chromium; Microbial community; Phenanthrene","Combined effects; Community compositions; Community responses; Contaminated soils; Degrading bacteria; Dehydrogenase activities; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; Dry soils; Elimination rates; Microbial community; Oxygen availabilities; Phenanthrene; Phenanthrene mineralizations; Soil communities; Soil microbial activities; Soil microcosms; Anthracene; Bacteriology; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Carbon dioxide; Chromium; Chromium compounds; Colloids; Contamination; Degradation; Electrophoresis; Gelation; Groundwater; Mineralogy; Moisture control; Oxygen; Pollution; Soil moisture; Soils; Vegetation; Soil pollution; chromium; phenanthrene; phenanthrene derivative; bioremediation; chromium; community dynamics; electrokinesis; enzyme activity; gel; microbial community; microcosm; oxygen; PAH; phenanthrene; soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil pollution; article; bacterium; bioremediation; metabolism; microbiology; soil pollutant; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromium; Phenanthrenes; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

In this study, two different GIS based landslide susceptibility maps were generated in the mountainous part of the Trikala Prefecture in Thessaly, Central Greece. This was accomplished by using different methods for correlating factors, which have an effect on landslide occurrences. The instability factors taken into account were: lithology, tectonic features, slope gradients, road network, drainage network, land use and rainfall. A frequency distribution of the half number of the landslide events of the study area in each class of the instability factors was performed in order to rate the classes. Two models have been used to combine the instability factors and assess the overall landslide susceptibility, namely: the Weight Factor Model (WeF), which is a statistical method, and the Multiple Factor Model (MuF) that is a logical method. The produced maps were classified into four zones: Low, Moderate, High and Very High susceptible zones and validated using the other half number of the landslide events of the area.

The secondary data analyses cover 75 countries in 2001-02 and 122 countries in 2006-07, reflecting business perceptions of the institutional environments and e-commerce diffusions in those countries. The results of the study indicate that at the infant stage of e-commerce, the supportive government policy was a powerful facilitator for e-commerce diffusion around the world. As e-commerce becomes more prevalent, e-commerce diffusion is more business-driven and the government policy loses its significance. Meanwhile, as companies engage more in e-commerce, the legal environment becomes an important factor in e-commerce diffusion. The study confirms various institutional environments exert influences on countries' e-commerce diffusion at various stages of e-commerce development.

To this end, we review different model concepts (together with model structures and corresponding parameter sets) proposed for processes such as two-step nitrification/denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation and phosphorus uptake processes. After critically discussing these models with respect to their assumptions and parameter sets, common points of agreement as well as disagreement were elucidated. From this discussion a general picture of the state-of-the-art in the modelling of nitrite is provided. Taking this into account, a number of recommendations are provided to focus further research and development on nitrite modelling in biological wastewater treatment. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Biological wastewater treatment; Model parameter; Model structure; Modelling; Nitrite","ammonia; nitrite; phosphorus; article; denitrification; nitrification; oxidation; waste water management; Ammonia; Models, Theoretical; Nitrites; Review Literature as Topic; Waste Disposal, Fluid",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

He argued that innovation-in the form of new production processes, new products and services, and organizational changes in the business world-is the driving force behind economic development (Schumpeter 1911). The great number of publications regarding innovation processes and conditions in the last thirty years is evidence enough of the continuing relevancy of this statement. In East Asian countries too, innovation has become the driving force behind sustained economic growth (Hage and Hollingsworth 2000; Yusuf and Evenett 2002; Yusuf et al. 2003; Yusuf et al. 2004; OECD 2001; OECD 2004b; UNCTAD 2003). Technological innovations in particular are ascribed a key roll in the development of national economies (OECD 2004a; WEF 2004:5). For example, the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report compares 80 countries' competitiveness, basing measurements mainly on technological capacity.1 This paper dedicates itself to the question of Korea's innovative potential for the advancement of one of the key technologies of the 21st century, nanotechnology. Due to insufficient data2, a truly comprehensive analysis cannot be made. Instead, this paper provides an initial review of Korea's activities and of its international competitive position in the area of nanotechnology. To answer this question, the national system of innovation has been observed in this paper. A system of innovation plays a central role in the competitiveness of a country, even in times of increasing globalization (Yusuf et al. 2003:141). A national system of innovation is defined as follows: ""The network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies may be described as the national system of innovation."" (Freeman 1992) Many of the learning processes between the state and the various other actors involved take place within this system. The state interacts with economic, scientific, and societal actors within a network of institutions through which new technologies are initiated, imported, modified and diffused. The innovative capacity of this system is crucially dependant upon the effective interaction of all parties, upon motivational structures, and upon interdependencies in the national institutional context. In times of increasing globalization, the national system of innovation plays a central role in the competitive capacity of a country (see e.g. Yusuf et al. 2003:141; Rammert 2000). Globalization has contributed to the accelerated opening up of innovation systems, with a trend towards regional or even supranational systems of innovation (Corning 2004; Doloreux and Porto n.d.). Already, ""techno-globalism"" is frequently mentioned. Nevertheless, the national system of innovation stands at the forefront as the most important area of refer nce for politicians, leading to this article taking a closer look at Korea's national system of innovation. The fact that companies from Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea occupy central positions in production and distribution networks within Asia, and even globally, has been incorporated into this paper's assessment of the innovative capacity (FEER 2006; Meyer-Krahmer 1999; Lundvall and Borras 1997). It is assumed that the following parameters must be fulfilled for a system of innovation to boost the innovative capacity of a country3: research infrastructure, fine-tuned and coordinated scientific and technological policies, and R&D expenditures, especially in basic research by research facilities and companies. R&D activities themselves are strongly dependant upon human resource quality, above all upon a high level of worker education and proficiency. In addition, knowledge within the system of innovation must be sufficiently diffused. The exchange of knowledge between the sciences and the economy is very important due to its stimulating effect on innovation and the commercialization of research results. The internationalization of research through regional and international networks as well as through the development of multinational corporation R&D centers is becoming increasingly meaningful. 'Innovation clusters' integrated into the global market are considered to stimulate regionally (Yusuf et al. 2003:223-269). Furthermore, a well-developed ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) infrastructure is important for saving and diffusing knowledge, and for increasing productivity. Finally, the factors mentioned above cannot be effective without an innovationfriendly political and social framework. This includes social acceptance of innovations, open markets and competition, the protection of intellectual property, and also political aid measures, e.g. for the foundation of companies (see Yusuf et al. 2003:144-153; Pascha and Philipsenburg 2002; Mahlich 2003). To what degree does the Korean national system of innovation fulfill requirements for developing nanotechnology? This question should be answered based upon qualitative and quantitative data, keeping the factors mentioned above in mind. It must be noted that viable, quantitatively comparable data are of very limited availability, especially in the area of nanotechnology. For this reason, this paper does not represent a comprehensive analysis. The data and interpretations herein provide indications of the most important trends. The system of innovation has been separated into input (expenditures for R&D, human resources, etc.) and output (e.g. number of triadic patents). This analysis observes specific characteristics of nanotechnology such as its strong dependence upon science, multidisciplinary character, currently high development and innovative dynamic, and time-and cost-intensive product development. © Physica-Verlag Heidelberg 2007.",,,,,,,,"English",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

We focus on general block-fading channels, wherein each data packet or frame spans a number of independent fading blocks. BICM applied to such channel environments can effectively exploit both time and frequency selectivity, while a STTC maximizes the spacial diversity order. The exact pairwise error probability (PEP) and weight enumeration function (WEF) of BISTTC are used to evaluate the error bound. Due to the concatenation of an outer error correction code (ECC) and a STTC, the overall WEF of BISTTC is obtained by combining the WEF of the outer code with that of the STTC through an uniform interleaver. The main challenge here is to compute the WEF of a STTC for block-fading channels with reasonable complexity. We rely on constructing a composite state transition matrix based on a number of single-step virtual trellises, each corresponding to an independent fading block within a frame. We discuss how this approach reduces storage and computational requirements in the bound analysis, compared to the existing method of obtaining the state transition matrix through accumulation of single-step transition matrices. The derived bound is applicable to both spatially uncorrelated and correlated channels as well as to both flat and frequency-selective block-fading channels. The bound is shown to provide a reasonably close estimate of the simulated performance based on the turbo equalizer-like iterative processing of soft information between the STTC decoder and the ECC decoder. © 2007 IEEE.","Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM); Bit-interleaved space-time trellis coding (BISTTC); Block fading; Weight enumeration function (WEF)","Encoding (symbols); Errors; Fading channels; Matrix algebra; Probability; Bit-interleaved coded modulation; Bit-interleaved space-time trellis coding; Block fading; Weight enumeration function; Trellis codes",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The solution, in general scaling problems, requires the match of all the relevant non-dimensional parameters to take place individually. However, in water film dynamics similarity, we encounter that is not possible for both Reynolds and Weber numbers to be matched simultaneously, and the strict individual parameter similarity condition has to be relaxed and combination of parameters accepted as a reasonable compromise. In this paper, a film Weber number will be defined and then proposed as a similarity parameter along with the non-dimensional film thickness as well as others that have been long recognized as well established, to form the set of equations that determine the scaled variables in terms of the reference ones. The water film Weber number (Wef) is defined for the airfoil leading edge region and based on the water film thickness and the water film edge velocity, besides the water properties of density and surface tension (water/surface). In order that this parameter can be easily handled in practice, the edge film velocity is written in terms of the external flow velocity through the air/water interface shear equality. This permits finally to write Wef in terms of the non-dimensional water film thickness followed by the product of Reynolds and Weber numbers, both based on external velocity and body dimensions. A first group of icing evaluation examples is included for the case of small droplets (Appendix C) and relatively high LWC, where the film thickness is experimentally measured at room temperature and the similarity scale results evaluated in icing conditions, through comparison with other methods that offer values for the scale variables that are close to the ones obtained by the present method. The second group of examples considered is for large droplets (SLD) and the corresponding set of scale variables obtained are evaluated in icing conditions, using the same procedure as for the Appendix C cases.

During the present decade the correlation has been at its lowest significance in the highly developed countries; in the countries similar to Russia it is, in fact, nil. The basic cause of it is the combination of the positive influence of the government support of R&D and the negative influence of high taxes together with financing non-effective enterprises. The correlation between economic growth and the degree of income discrepancy is also subject to the oscillations. At present the absence of correlation in highly developed countries and negative correlation in countries similar to Russia is noted.

This is imperative if the goals of ""Education for All"" (EFA) are to be achieved (p. 14): The key challenge is to ensure that the broad vision of Education for All . . . must take account of the need of the poor and the most disadvantaged, including working children, remote rural dwellers and nomads, and ethnic and linguistic minorities, children, young people and adults affected by conflict, HIV/AIDS, hunger and poor health; and those with special learning needs. All over the world HIV/AIDS is causing devastation by its destructive effects on families and communities. At the end of 2003, a report was issued by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the status of HIV/AIDS in the world (UNAIDS/ WHO, 2004). The report showed that about 37 million adults (aged 15-49) and 2.5 million children (aged 0-14) were living with the HIV in different parts of the world. During the same period, about 5 million people in different parts of the world contracted HIV, which causes AIDS, and there were about 3 million deaths from HIV/AIDS. Since the beginning of the epidemic, UNAIDS/WHO (2004) estimate that worldwide about 63 million men, women, and children have been infected with HIV and 21.8 million people have died of AIDS. This includes 4.3 million children. The epidemic hits those between 15 and 24 years of age particularly hard. This is the age group from which second- and third-level educational institutions draw the majority of their students. At present, more than 40 million people are now living with HIV, most of whom are likely to die over the next decade or so. However, with the HIV-positive population still expanding, the annual number of AIDS deaths will continue to increase for many years. Despite the universal ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is still discrimination against children infected with HIV/AIDS, for instance, when the rights of these children to education, health, and social services are denied or restricted. Children with HIV/AIDS often suffer from the effects the epidemic has on their close or extended families and their communities. The lives of children infected with HIV/AIDS become quite precarious as a result of societal and family abandonment and rejection, which forces some children to live on the streets and support themselves by such means as prostitution. Such violations of children's rights can be the result of their real or perceived HIV/AIDS status or that of members of their families; they can also make those children not already infected become more susceptible to infection. In short, the impact of the epidemic on families, households, and communities is often even greater on the young people within them. The impact of HIV/AIDS is diverse. It affects production, as well as household incomes and expenditures. It poses major problems for health systems and health care practices. The epidemic has a severe impact on schools and education (Chilisa and Bennell, 2001; Kelly, 1999, 2000a-c). According to recent statistics from UNAIDS (2000a,b, 2002, 2003, 2004), the number of children under the age of 15 who lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS is about 14 million. Over 11 million of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa, 1.8 million in South and Southeast Asia, 85,000 in East Asia and the Pacific, while 330,000 live in Latin America. By 2001 there were 250,000 cases in the Caribbean, 65,000 in North Africa and the Middle East (UNAIDS, 2000a,b, 2002, 2003, 2004), and 3.5 million reported cases in Nigeria (Okorie, 2004).

One aspect of WEF is an integrated prevention plan to minimize solid waste generation. In the past, the waste reduction plan was based primarily on recycling and composting of festival waste. Implementation of this system included compatible material specifications for event food vendors, modified collection systems and waste sorting. Apart from the above mentioned a large set of reusable dishware was purchased including plates, cups, chopsticks and utensils. Discussed in this paper are the planning, operation and results of the reusable dishware program, which started in 2002. The problem most commonly encountered initially was an insufficient amount of small denominations of currency for deposit refunds. Other issues encountered were the occasional use of disposable products by the vendors when reusable items were not cycled through the system fast enough. When compared to the average of 1998 and 2000, the reusable dishware system in 2005 reduced the overall weight of waste, compost, and recyclables (not including cardboard) by 27, 27, and 36%, respectively; the overall volume of these materials was reduced by 62, 41, and 52%, respectively. The per capita waste generation rate was reduced from 0.22 to 0.19 kg/capita-day. Determined valuable backups of the system include: appropriate biodegradable backup products in case the reusable system fails for any reason; better educational signage on the reusable system and accompanying deposit information for eliminating the loss of dishware from the festival; finally, a dedicated volunteer staff for efficient operation of the reusable dishware system and overall waste management system. © by PSP 2006.","Compostable items; Reusable dishware; Special events; Whole Earth Festival (WEF)","composting; domestic waste; planning process; recycling; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; California; Davis; North America; United States",,,,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Examination of the accuracy of analysts' earnings forecasts allows us to judge how accounting systems and macroeconomic distinctions in this region affect earnings predictability. As many investors rely on analysts' earnings forecasts instead of producing their own, the growth of international investment means forecasts in non-US markets will become increasingly important to investors worldwide. Using a sample of firms with data available on Global Vantage and I/B/E/S International, we find that the analysts on average have a pessimistic bias in Asian-Pacific markets. We examine whether macroeconomic factors explain part of the difference in the size of analyst forecast errors, using the global competitiveness rankings of the World Economic Forum (WEF). We expect that those nations which are more open to foreign trade and investment and are ranked more highly by the WEF in its Global Competitiveness Index will also have more accurate analyst forecasts, as increased global competitiveness demands greater integration into the world economy, and such integration should lead to more transparent financial statements and more accurate earnings forecasts.

Some species show strong anti-tumour and antioxidant activity by enhancing various immune system functions and lowering cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, there are also some safety concerns. Edible species might be mistaken for poisonous ones, high heavy-metal concentrations in wild edible fungi (WEF) are a known source of chronic poisoning and the consumption of WEF can contribute markedly to the radiocaesium intake of human subjects.

These models are commonly used to establish the linkage of a variety of water quality targets and sources, and to provide a means for comparing various watershed and waterbody management strategies. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Environmental Research Laboratory (NERL), Ecosystem Research Division (ERD), is currently supporting EPA's Office of Emergency Response and Remediation (OERR) by addressing priority research needs related to assessing the fate and transport of pollutants via contaminated sediment and bioaccumulation. The results of the first support effort by ERD, an evaluation of currently available numerical models useful for assessing fate and transport of contaminated sediments (Imhoff et al., 2003), were presented at the fall 2003 WEF TMDL Conference (Imhoff, 2003). The worleffort presented in this paper constitutes the second element of the support effort by ERD, a parallel evaluation of currently available numerical models useful for assessing chemical bioaccumulation. Eight models were identified that were judged superior to all others in their promise as tools for chemical bioaccumulation analysis. To provide ERD with a basis on which to compare these models, a head-to-head comparison of the models was developed applying a high level of scrutiny to both model science and model usability.

The Stormvault™ Mitigation System has met that goal, utilizing the ""Water Quality Capture Volume"" (WQCV) sizing criteria as documented in ""Urban Runoff Quality Management"", WEF Manual of Practice No. 23 and ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. Third party monitoring of over 60 individual storm events confirms pollutant removal capabilities of Stormvault's ASCE sizing method, Earles, et al., 2002, Yu and Fassman, 2001. The tests document TSS pollutant discharge quality is superior to the listed removals comparable to traditional stormwater BMPs, as listed on the ASCE Database, Earles, 2002. The Mean WQCV is shown to be optimized to promote capture of approximately 86 percent of the average annual total suspended sediments in normal urban stormwater, based on, Driscoll et al., 1989 and detention time based on, Guo and Urbonas, 1996. The third party testing of the Stormvault™ demonstrated that the ASCE ""mean"" WQCV criteria, utilizing the innovative patented baffle configuration, completely captures and treats up to 77% of the runoff hydrograph events for each design locale including the ""first flush"" of larger events. This ASCE mean event capture volume significantly reduces erosion and stream degradation from increased flows due to urbanization and helps restore pre-development runoff rates. Empirical calculations based on, Grizzard et al., 1986 and ""Hazen's surface area loading"" illustrates the Stormvault's ability to provide capture of TSS particles less than 70 microns in size and the retention of additional pollutants of concern such as heavy metals, nutrients and chemical oxygen demand.",,"Maximum extent practical (MEP); Stormwater treatment; Watershed management; Degradation; Pollution; Sediments; Water quality; Water treatment; Watersheds","American Society of Civil Engineers, EWRI","2005 Watershed Management Conference - Managing Watersheds for Human and Natural Impacts: Engineering, Ecological, and Economic Challenges","19 July 2005 through 22 July 2005","Williamsburg, VA",65993,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

WEF can reflect the wavelet energy distribution of the principal lines, wrinkles and ridges in different directions at different resolutions (scales), thus it can efficiently characterize palmprints. This paper also analyses the discriminabilities of each level WEF and, according to these discriminabilities, chooses a suitable weight for each level to compute the weighted city block distance for recognition. The experimental results show that the order of the discriminabilities of each level WEF, from strong to weak, is the 4th, 3rd, 5th, 2nd and 1st level.

As outlined in this chapter, all such policies have failed as indicated by the level of poverty, indebtedness, and heavy dependence on foreign aid of countries in the region by the early 2000s. An example of a failed policy is that of the structural adjustment programs (SAPs). In the 1980s and 1990s governments in sub-region hit by the debt crisis were required by the World Bank and the International Monetary fund to implement SAPs in order for existing loans to be rescheduled and new loans/grants to be given. SAPs were packages of policy reforms that aimed to achieve macro-economic stability and export led growth, on the assumption that this would reduce poverty. SAP involved structural policy reforms such as the privatization of state owned enterprises, removal of subsidies for domestic industry, agriculture and liberalization of international trade through the reduction/removal of import duties. SAPs also included monetary reforms such as currency devaluation, liberalization of the financial sector, and tightened fiscal discipline through, for example, public sector wage cuts or introduction of user fees for health and education service (Elu, 2000). However, after three decades of practicing structural adjustment, the programs resulted in limited economic growth, increased income inequalities and in some cases reduced access to health care and education for the vast majority of the population (World Bank, 2003). Designed in Washington, the programs undermined national ownership of policy making, through adopting externally imposed reforms. As outlined in the chapter, SAPs were a failure as economic growth in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa stalled and in certain states disintegrated. A recent (2004) World Economic Forum (WEF) report indicated that income per head has fallen by 11% in the sub-region since 1974 (WEF, 2003). By the late 1990s there was a global outcry over the devastating effects of poor country debt and over the failure of SAPs to reduce poverty (Elu, 2000; Riddell, 1992, 1999). The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund moved away from SAPs and adopted a new approach - Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). Under this new approach national governments are to develop their own national poverty reduction strategy as the basis for accessing lending and aid grants from international donors. On paper, one of the key elements of PRSP is ""national ownership."" For a PRSP to be nationally owned strategies are to be developed with broad-based participation from civil society. In practice, PRSP is an externally imposed requirement that governments must produce to access financing and which the World Bank has to approve. It is paradoxical to call PRSP country-driven when governments have chosen policies the IFIs will approve rather than making policy choices based on the views put forward by citizens (Sutton, 1996). PRSP contents reflect the dominance of IFI policy prescriptions instead of the priorities of the poor. Policies opposed by the poor (such as user fees for education and healthcare) are common, while policies the poor want are not included (free schooling and health care). The World Bank/IMF guidelines for writing the PRSP are considered to have strong neo-liberal assumptions resulting in neo-liberal policy recommendations. This coupled with the need for IFI approval, gives the IFIs inordinate power over the contents of national PRSPs. Despite the macro policy contents of PRSPs, in essence the same discredited structural adjustment policies are being re-imposed. International Financial Institutions continue to be unwilling to seek or consider policy alternatives and continue to assume that structural adjustment policies automatically contribute to poverty reduction without thorough analysis of the likely poverty effect at country level. The promised reduction in conditionalities has not been forthcoming. The insufficiency of debt relief coupled with inadequate development assistance and the unreliability of both debt relief and aid flows renders the planning and implementation of PRSPs difficult. The debt relief currently being supplied through HIPC is insufficient to enable the required levels of growth and reduce poverty. After receiving debt relief most HIPC countries will continue to have unsustainable external debt whilst increasing their internal debt as illustrated in Table 1. Donors however, continue to use the debt sustainability approach rather than working for debt cancellation. Unpredictable aid transfers also lead to programs not being implemented Fig. 11 indicates the new pattern of aid flow. During the 1990s, aid to Africa fell by a third, from $17bn at the start of the decade to $12bn at the end (Lusekelo, 2004). Uncertainty over and fluctuations in donor fulfillment of pledges renders planning extremely difficult, yet there are no sanctions on donors who default or delay payment. Women, children, indigenous groups and those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS are often disproportionately hit by the negative social impacts of economic policies. Despite this their situations are not considered neither are special measures targeted at them under PRSPs. In the end, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have replaced one set of conditionalities for another, without any improvement in living conditions for women, the poor, the elderly and children. As stated by the former United Kingdom (U.K.) International Development Minister, Clare Short, ""Africa is the poorest continent and it's getting poorer.""13. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

By assuming that they de facto involve a high constituency of power, it proposes to shift the focus of investigation away from a search for evidence of power towards a perspective that could be defined as a hermeneutics of limits. Building upon the concept of social myth forged by the French thinker Georges Sorel, it posits that the separation of transnational élite clubs from the public sphere constitutes both their strength and their weakness. Their organisational principles entail a clear-cut cleavage between a coopted minority and the formal institutions of representative democracy. This scission is supposed to arouse the sense of an exclusive community and, therefore, to reinforce the idea of its shared responsibility towards the future of the world. Yet it also impinges upon the capacity to institutionalise the views held within those confined circles. This has been well illustrated by the difficulties that the WEF has encountered recently. The more the influence of the WEF is perceived, the harder it will be for it to pretend to a legitimate role in the shaping of world-wide issues in the future. The argument is divided into six sections. The first provides a brief overview of the scholarship on transnational élite clubs, with a particular emphasis on transnational historical materialist approaches. The second elaborates the relevance of the Sorelian concept of social myth to complement those approaches. The third introduces the case of the WEF. The fourth section provides an historical account of its origins and shows how it was from the outset an attempt to forge a synthesis between social myth and hegemonic planning. The fifth examines how this original setting developed into a success story. The sixth analyses the current difficulties of the Forum, the limits of its influence and its inability to engage reforms securing its future.

The mechanical properties of WEF were thoroughly studied by many authors. The researches of external skeletal fixator include the stability of the frame structure, fatigue or failure model of pins, exploration of biomechanical characteristics of pin-bone interface, and the strength of pin clamps. The mechanical models and cadaver bone were frequently used to test the WEF. For most of the studies, the stiffness (or stability) of the construct was the criteria to evaluate the WEF. In these many studies, however, the mechanical contribution of pins was less studied. Due to the non-weight bearing property and prevention of injuries from the soft tissue of peri-wrist, the structure and elements of WEF are designed to be small and slender. It is hence important to find if all pins of WEF were necessary or proper designed. We tested the mechanical function of Traumafix WEF using the mechanical model, the cadaver model and in vivo patient model. The strains of the pins on the top surface were analyzed. The data showed that the load distribution of each pins were different from pins to pins, and from models to models.

Toilet training is not complete in children below 4 years of age. Manometric and radiological studies need cooperation of the child, and are therefore of little value during the critical preschool years. In this present study, we used only clinical criteria to assess the child for constipation and incontinence after definitive operation. We included all patients of ARM wef 01 April 1998 to 31 March 2000. Only 2 children had crossed 4 years of age at the time of this assessment and therefore it was not possible to assess total continence postoperatively. We found that the incidence of incontinence was less in low anomalies and more in high or intermediate anomalies, while the incidence of constipation was higher in low anomalies and less in high and intermediate anomalies. 31% of all patients born with anorectal malformations and subjected to posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) approach were totally continent, 38% suffered with soiling of faeces while 31% had problems of constipation. The higher incidence of constipation as well as incontinence in our study is because of a short follow-up and secondly, these problems are known to improve with passage of time.

The features in a palmprint include principal lines, wrinkles and ridges, etc. Line structure feature, which includes principal lines and wrinkles, is one of the most popular methods in palmprint recognition. However, the line structure feature does not contain the thickness and width information of principal lines and wrinkles, which are very important to discriminate palmprints. Ridges are not included in line structure feature either. So these methods cannot distinguish different palmprints with similar line structure. Furthermore, the line extraction is a difficult task. The fact that principal lines, wrinkles and ridges have different resolutions motivates us to analyze the palmprint using multi-resolution analysis method. A novel palmprint feature, named wavelet energy features, is defined employing wavelet, which is a powerful tool of multi-resolution analysis, in this paper. WEF can reflect the wavelet energy distribution of the principal lines, wrinkles and ridges in several directions at different wavelet decomposition level (scale), so its ability to discriminate palms is very strong. Easiness to compute is another virtue of WEF. The very high recognition rates obtained in experiments shows the effect of the proposed method.","Biometrics; Feature extraction; Palmprint recognition; Wavelet energy feature","Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Optical resolving power; Two dimensional; Wavelet transforms; Biometrics; Line extraction; Multi-resolution analysis method; Palmprint recognition; Software Package MATLAB; Wavelet energy feature; Optical character recognition","Hebei University;IEEE systems, Man and Cybernetics technical Comm. on Cybernetics","Proceedings of 2002 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","4 November 2002 through 5 November 2002","Beijing",60776,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus

Capillary forces attach the flowing etchant solution to the underside of the optic being figured. No mechanical or thermal stresses or residues are applied to the optic by this process. This enables interferometric measurement of the glass thickness while surfacing, which then controls the placement and dwell time of the wetted zone. The result is a truly deterministic, closed-loop figuring process with a high degree of optical precision.

In the past decade, the cancer-protective effects of garlic have been well established by epidemiologic studies and animal experiments. However, the cardiovascular-protective properties of garlic are less well understood. In particular, despite the reported hypocholesterolemic effect of garlic, the mechanism of the effect is unclear. In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study, we showed that aged garlic extract (AGE) supplementation was effective in lowering plasma concentration of total cholesterol by 7% and LDL cholesterol by 10% in hypercholesterolemic men compared with subjects consuming a placebo. Supplementation of AGE in animal diets similarly reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triacylglycerol by 15 and 30%, respectively. In subsequent experiments using cultured rat hepatocytes, we found 44-87% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the water-extractable fraction (WEF), methanol-extractable fraction (MEF) and petroleum ether-extractable fraction (PEF) of fresh garlic, and Kyolic (liquid form of AGE). These observations suggested that hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds of garlic are inhibitory to cholesterol synthesis. Because S-allylcysteine (SAC) alone was less potent than Kyolic, which contains SAC and other sulfur compounds, a maximal inhibition appears to require a concerted action of multiple compounds of garlic. In a series of experiments, we further characterized the inhibitory potency of individual water-soluble and lipid-soluble compounds of garlic. Among water-soluble compounds, SAC, S-ethylcysteine (SEC), and S-propylcysteine (SPC) inhibited cholesterol synthesis by 40-60% compared with 20-35% by γ-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine (GSAC), γ-glutamyl-S-methylcysteine (GSMC) and γ-glutamyl-S-propylcysteine (GSPC). Lipid-soluble sulfur compounds (i.e., diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, dipropyl sulfide and dipropyl trisulfide) at low concentrations (0.05-0.5 mol/L) slightly (10-15%)inhibited cholesterol synthesis but became highly cytotoxic at high concentrations (1.0-4.0 mol/L). All water-soluble compounds, except S-allylmercaptocysteine, were not cytotoxic, judging from the release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium. Taken together, the results of our studies indicate that the cholesterol-lowering effects of garlic extract, such as AGE, stem in part from inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis by water-soluble sulfur compounds, especially SAC.","Cholesterol; Garlic; Hepatocyte; Organosulfur compounds; Triacylglycerol","cysteine; garlic extract; hypocholesterolemic agent; lactate dehydrogenase; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; methanol; organosulfur derivative; placebo; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; cholesterol synthesis; conference paper; drug potency; epidemiological data; extraction; human; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; hypercholesterolemia; liver cell; nonhuman; Allium sativum; Animalia",,,,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

Fibers included water-extracted steam-exploded fibers (WEF), alkali extracted fibers (AEF), acetylated fibers (AAEF), and a commercial milled oat fiber sample (COF) (i.e., untreated control). The results indicate that the thermal stability of steam-exploded fibers increases progressively as the fibers are extracted with water and alkali and following acetylation.

The modification by acetylation contributed to improved interfacial wetting that was revealed by increased torque during melt processing.

Exercise intolerance is an integral component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) and is caused by several mechanisms that ultimately impact overall functional capacity. We assessed various components of exercise function in patients with CHD and COPD during the course of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation to evaluate changes unique to each condition. Methods. Work efficiency (WEf, defined as Δwatts/Δ VO2) and peak VO2 were measured and compared at baseline and after 3 months (36 sessions) of outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs in 25 patients (mean age = 66 ± 7 years) with severe COPD (mean FEV1.0 = 0.90±0.35 L) and in 25 patients (mean age = 65 ± 8 years) with CHD. Results. At baseline, patients with COPD had significantly reduced values of WEf (2.04 ± 0.86 versus 3.23 ± 1.38 watts/mL/kg/min; P = 0.004) and peak VO2 (13.2 ± 3.9 versus 17.1 ± 3.9 mL/kg/min; P = 0.005) compared with patients with CHD. After rehabilitation, patients with CHD increased peak VO2 by 12% (17.1 ± 3.9 to 19.1 ± 4.9 mL/kg/min; P = 0.01) with no change in WEf (3.23 ± 1.38 to 3.32 ± 1.43 watts/mL/kg/min; P = not significant). In contrast, patients with COPD increased peak VO2 by only 5% (13.2 ± 3.9 to 13.9 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min; P = 0.0008), but WEf increased by 36% (2.04 ± 0.86 to 2.78 ± 0.84 watts/mL/kg/min; P = 0.0002). Subjective measures of functional status improved similarly in both groups. Conclusions. In contrast to patients with CHD, work inefficiency contributes significantly to exercise intolerance in patients with severe COPD. Outpatient rehabilitation programs enhance functional status in patients with CHD and COPD by differing mechanisms, depending on the underlying disease. These data show the disparate effects of out-patient rehabilitation on peak VO2 and WEf in cardiac and pulmonary patients.","Functional status; Muscle work; Oxygen consumption; Rehabilitation","adult; aged; article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; coronary artery disease; heart rehabilitation; human; job performance; lung capacity; peak expiratory flow; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Ambulatory Care; Coronary Disease; Energy Metabolism; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Fitness; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; Rehabilitation; Work of Breathing",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

The objective of this study was to compare the use of fractal dimension (D), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and alpha (α) parameters as indices to characterize the temporal changes in ASD of a soil subsequent to the incorporation of an oily waste sludge. Soil samples for dry and wet aggregate size distribution (DASD and WASD, respectively) measurements were collected from a loamy sand during a 4-yr period following sludge incorporation. Sludge incorporation produced a continuous oil content, i.e., 0, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, and 7.0%, variable in the soil (by mass). The wind erodible fraction (WEF; <0.84 mm) in the sludge treated plots decreased from 80 to 38% but increased with time to 78% 4 yr later. The reduction in WEF was reflected as gains in larger size fractions which decreased with time. The 4.76- to 8-mm water stable aggregates in the sludge treated pints increased from 10 to 80% but decreased with time to 40% 4 yr later. An opposite trend was observed for smaller size aggregates.

The present experiment also demonstrates that Ca2+ flux is an important primary response of macrophages to a low-amplitude, low-frequency weak electric field (WEF).

If a shortened exposure (30 s) is applied, the effective electric strength increases to 100 V cm-1. The WEF-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is also related to the amount of Ca2+ and Mg2- in buffers.

For example, the appearance of the human immunodeficiency virus initially increased concerns for workers at wastewater treatment facilities. Concerns about water supplies have heightened with the prevalence of giardia and cryptosporidium, especially given their resistance to current disinfection practices. These concerns may suggest the need for more effective and continuous disaffection. In 1990, WEF sent survey forms to 1,000 POTWs and received 351 responses. The findings showed that - 78% of the respondents use chlorine or hypochlorite for disinfection. Of those, 28% practice dechlorination. In the dechlorination category, 55% have manual controls and 15% use a flow-paced system. - 19% use ultraviolet irradiation for disinfection, and - 3% use other methods. Given the large percentage of dechlorination systems controlled manually, these findings suggest that the potential for exceeding the limits for chlorine residual is strong. lf limits are in fact exceeded, receiving waters may not be benefiting to the degree expected from dechlorination. The need for an assessment of the situation is obvious. Ten POTWs reported using something other than chlorine or ultraviolet irradiation. Some fraction would be using ozone and maybe bromine chloride, but it is unclear whether some POTWs do not practice disinfection.",,"Chlorination; Disinfection; Health risks; Public risks; Discharge limits; Public health; Sterilizing effluent; Water treatment",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

A variety of laboratory tests used to characterize the system performance are described. Among them, the particle passing efficiency of the denuder was evaluated using NH4NO3 particles (diameters &lt; 1 μm) generated by a new method. Ambient measurements using this method were compared with the Nylon and Teflon filter pack method at three field sites: a loblolly pine forest in rural Alabama; a suburban site in Boulder, CO; and a rural mountain site: near Nederland, CO. The methods intercomparison was carried out at sites with varying nitric acid mixing ratios, with the whole data set ranging from &lt; 0.1 to 4 ppbv nitric acid. The nitric acid measurements collected using the WED method compared very well with the filter pack method (linear regression results: slope = 1.00 ± 0.05, r = 0.97). Particulate nitrate and sulfate measurements were compared pnly in Alabama. The particulate sulfate measured with the wet effluent frit and with the filter pack agreed within 12% on average. The particulate nitrate measured using the frit was much higher than that measured by the filter pack, and in addition, the WEF nitrate exhibited a strong diurnal variation while the filter pack nitrate did not. Principal component analysis has been performed on the data set as a means to elucidate the cause of this difference, and to examine the atmospheric variability observed during the Alabama study. © 1995.","denuder; field measurements; nitrate; nitric acid; particles; principal component analysis; sulfate; WED; WEF","Filter pack method; Ion chromatography; Principal component analysis; Sulfates; Wet effluent denuder; Wet effluent frit sampling system; Chromatography; Nitrates; Nitric acid; Particles (particulate matter); Performance; Regression analysis; Sulfur compounds; Vapors; Atmospheric chemistry; nitrate; nitric acid; sulfate; nitrate; nitric acid; nylon; politef; sulfate; air analysis; ambient air; article; circadian rhythm; conductance; forest; geographic distribution; ion pair chromatography; laboratory test; particulate matter; pine; priority journal; united states; urban area; vapor; atmosphere; effluent; filter; laboratory; sampling; species; Pinus taeda; method evaluation; nitrate; nitric acid vapour",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Rat hepatocytes in primary culture were used to determine the short-term effects of garlic preparations on [1-14C]acetate and [2-3H]glycerol incorporation into cholesterol, fatty acids and glycerol lipids. When compared with the control group, cells treated with a high concentration of garlic extracts [i.e., petroleum ether- (PEF), methanol- (MEF) and water-extractable (WEF) fractions from fresh garlic] showed decreased rates of [1-14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol (by 37-64%) and into fatty acids (by 28-64%). Kyolic containing S-allyl cysteine and organosulfur compounds inhibited cholesterogenesis in a concentration dependent manner with a maximum inhibition of 87% at 0.4 mM. At this concentration, Kyolic decreased [1-14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids by 67%. S-allyl cysteine at 2.0 and 4.0 mM inhibited cholesterogenesis by 20-25%. PEF, MEF and WEF depressed the rates of [2-3H]glycerol incorporation into triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol and phospholipids in the presence of acetate, but not in the presence of oleate. The results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effect of garlic stems, in part, from decreased hepatic cholesterogenesis, whereas the triacylglycerol-lowering effect appears to be due to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Primary hepatocyte cultures as used in the present study have been proven useful as tools for screening the anticholesterogenic properties of garlic principles. © 1994 American Oil Chemists' Society.",,"acetic acid; cholesterol; cysteine; diacylglycerol; ether; fatty acid; garlic extract; glycerol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; methanol; oleic acid; organosulfur derivative; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; water; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cholesterol synthesis; controlled study; fatty acid synthesis; garlic; lipid blood level; lipid diet; liver; liver cell; male; nonhuman; rat; thin layer chromatography; Acetates; Animal; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cells, Cultured; Cholesterol; Garlic; Glycerol; Lipids; Liver; Male; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides; Allium sativum; Animalia",,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Open renal biopsy and/or nephrectomy were performed at intervals from 4 hours to 14 days after the injection of carbon black suspension. The specimens were studied by light and electron microscopy. The results were as follows. Many aggregated carbon particles within the glomerular capillary lumina were found in the widened subendothelial space of capillary loops, endothelial fenestrae close to the portion of glomerular tufts and adjacent mesangial matrix in normal and hypercellular areas at 4 hours after carbon loading. By this time, many carbon particles were phago-cytosed by normal and degenerative mesangial cells, which were found in the areas showing normal cellularity, and were enclosed in the vacuoles with a single limiting membrane. At 24 hours and later after carbon loading the relative concentration of carbon particles in the mesangium of normal cellularity was reduced in the experimental animals as well as in the control ones. Increase of carbon particles within mononuclear cells in the glomerular lesions showing focal and segmental hypercellularity, however, were demonstrated from 24 hours to one week after carbon loading. The cells in hypercellular glomerular lesions were active mesangial cells, which contained either a few or many carbon particles, up to one week after the administration of Habu snake venom. In addition, macrophages with many carbon particles were frequently observed in these hypercellular areas.

Inhibitory post‐synaptic potentials evoked by adequate stimulation of group Ia muscle spindle afferents of homonymous and synergistic muscles and by selective electrical stimulation of tendon organ afferents were analysed in motoneurones of triceps surae and plantaris. 2. Selective activation of Ia afferents was verified to occur with brief stretches of triceps surae and plantaris 35 micrometer or less in amplitude with an initial muscle tension of 5 N; stretches of 30‐‐35 micrometer were estimated to activate 80‐‐90% of Ia afferents in these muscles. Under the same conditions the lowest thresholds for group Ib tendon organ afferents were about 40 micrometer. 3. Stretches less than or equal to 30 micrometer evoked i.p.s.p.s in 80% of triceps surae and plantaris motoneurones; lowest thresholds for evoking i.p.s.p.s wef triceps surae and plantaris motoneurones; lowest thresholds for evoking i.p.s.p.s were 10 micrometer or less. However, such low thresholds for stretch‐evoked i.p.s.p.s, lower than the thresholds for activation of Ib afferents, were found mainly in spinalized, unanaesthetized (after decerebration) or lightly anaesthetized animals. The latencies of these i.p.s.p.s indicated disynaptic and trisynaptic coupling between Ia afferents and motoneurones. The i.p.s.p.s were evoked (i) from the homonymous and synergistic muscles stretched together, (ii) from the homonymous muscles alone and (iii) from the synergistic muscles alone. 4. Control experiments showed that i.p.s.p.s could be evoked by stretches sub‐threshold for discharging motoneurones, thus showing that those i.p.s.p.s were not mediated by Renshaw cells. The stretch‐evoked i.p.s.p.s disappeared after sectioning the nerves from the corresponding muscles, further excluding their mediation by afferents other than group Ia afferents from thf stretched muscle. 5. In order to selectively activate tendon organ afferents, thresholds for excitation of Ia afferents by electrical stimuli were increased to a level above the threshold for Ib afferents by prolonged muscle vibration (Coppin, Jack & MacLennan, 1970). I.p.s.p.s evoked by stimuli near threshold for Ib afferents appeared with latencies indicating disynaptic coupling. Later (trisynaptic) components of Ib i.p.s.p.s required somewhat stronger stimuli. 6. Amplitudes of Ia i.p.s.p.s evoked by muscle stretches activating about 80% of muscle spindle afferents were compared with amplitudes of Ib i.p.s.p.s due to less than 50% of tendon organ afferents of the same muscles. The Ia i.p.s.p.s were much smaller (16‐‐35%) than the Ib i.p.s.p.s. The amplitudes of such Ia and Ib i.p.s.p.s constituted about 10 and 25‐‐66%, respectively, of the maximal i.p.s.p.s evoked by electrical stimulation of all group I afferents. 7.

We modified the method of Pappius and McCann (1969), who used radioactive iodinated I125 serum albumin (RISA) as a label for vasogenic BE fluid. To correct for intravascular plasma volume we used Cr51 labelled red blood cells and calculated equivalent extravascular plasma volume (EVPV). The modified RISA method was compared with a standard method for measuring increased tissue water, i.e. the change in wef.dry weights. Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to unilateral cortical freeze injury and sacrificed three hours later. The lesion corresponding to the area of blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown was delineated by Evan's blue staining. That area and the two adjacent poles were sectioned. The contralateral hemisphere was used as the control. Good agreement was found between the two methods. By the modified RISA method, 4.08% of the wet weight of the injured hemisphere was EVPV while the decrease in dry weight corresponded to 5.56% edema. In the freeze lesion, however, where BBB breakdown occurred extravascular (EV)protein exceeded EV water, while adjacent to the lesion in the area with intact BBB, EV water exceeded EV protein. This suggests that the diffusion rate for water through brain tissue exceeds that of albumin in the early stages of vasogenic BE formation. We conclude that the modified RISA method is a satisfactory measure of regional vasogenic BE in acute animal experiments. © 1979, Canadian Neurological Sciences Federation.

By means of numerical simulation a systematic study wefs made of the effects of reservoir and well parameters on water coning performance. Included were the effects of aquifer thickness, well penetration, pressure drawdown, and horizontal to vertical permeability ratio. These studies revealed that higher water-oil ratios, at every stage of depletion, resulted from increasing well penetration or increasing pressure drawdown at the producing well. Accompanying the increase in water-oil ratio is an increase in oil production rate of the same magnitude thus decreasing the operating life of the well. There is no indication that the ultimate oil recovery is adversely affected by increased production rates. As a matter of fact, it appears that high production rates could lead to improved economic oil recovery. Produced water-oil ratio at every stage of depletion is strongly influenced by the ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability and to a lesser degree by aquifer thickness. © Copyright 1973 American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Aquifers; Engineers; Gasoline; Horizontal wells; Numerical models; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Aquifer thickness; High production rate; Oil-production rates; Pressure drawdowns; Systematic study; Vertical permeabilities; Water oil ratios; Water production; Water levels",,"3rd Numerical Simulation of Reservoir Performance Symposium of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, NSS 1973","11 January 1973 through 12 January 1973",,140966,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus
